<hr class="short">

<p>In publishing a second edition of the “Memoirs of
Lady Hester Stanhope,” the Author does not feel
himself called upon to reply to the many desultory
criticisms on his work which have issued from the
press. It was naturally to be expected that, among
the numerous adherents of statesmen, noblemen, and
princes, whose lives had been commented upon in these
pages, there would be no lack of writers to vindicate
their reputation, or, failing in this, to censure the narrator.
But, to do so with vulgarity, as was the case
in two or three reviews, is surely departing from the
rules of literary courtesy, and must rather have
weakened their arguments than otherwise.</p>

<p>We read in the number of the Quarterly Review for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
September last (p. 449) a paragraph, which the writer
must have known was a misrepresentation of facts.
It is there asserted that the Earl Stanhope had given
a flat contradiction to a portion of Dr. M.’s <cite>Conversations</cite>.
Now, the critic ought to have been aware that
what his lordship denied was no part of the “Conversations,”
but an extract from a letter written by Lady
Hester herself to his Grace the Duke of Wellington;
and yet, not acting with the fairness and impartiality
which became him, and becomes every person
sitting in judgment on another, he forgets to give at
the same time the answer, and in this way hopes to cast
odium on the Author of the Memoirs, at the expense
of truth and justice. No apology therefore is needed
for inserting the answer, thus, it is to be hoped, unintentionally
omitted, and which was as <span class="lock">follows:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Author of the ‘Memoirs of Lady Hester
Stanhope’ presents his compliments to the Editor of
the <cite>Morning Post</cite>, and, in reference to that portion of
a letter from the Earl Stanhope, which appeared in
the <cite>Morning Post</cite> on the 10th inst., wherein his lordship
complains of an assertion ‘that he went to dine
in company with Mr. Fox when Mr. Pitt was on his
death-bed,’ begs leave to inform him that it was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">v</span>
made by Lady Hester Stanhope in conversation with
the Author (as might be inferred from his lordship’s
words), but was contained in a letter written by her
ladyship to the Duke of Wellington, and which was
published in the newspapers of the day. Consequently,
the Author of the Memoirs is in no wise responsible
for the accuracy or inaccuracy of the statement.</p>

<p>“With regard to the concluding paragraph of his
lordship’s letter, in which he says, ‘I may also express
my concern that any physician should have
considered it as consistent with his sense of propriety
to publish the report of conversations between himself
and one of his patients,’ the Author of the Memoirs
takes the liberty of observing that the contents of his
work are not confidential communications between a
physician and his patient, but conversations upon
domestic and public subjects, which had already been
repeated to many other persons, and which, he was
convinced, from her ladyship’s frequent recurrence to
the same topics, she was but too anxious should be
made known to the world. The Author, therefore, may
be excused if he adds that he has been as desirous to
observe the strict rules of propriety, and is as incapable
of violating private confidence, as his lordship himself.”</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
In other respects, the Author of the Memoirs has
no complaint to make. A reviewer promulgates his
opinions, which clash with those of an author, and
the public, if interested in the discussion, soon shows
its leaning. When the reviewer has done honour to
Lady Hester Stanhope’s noble qualities and her
virtues, the Author can readily forgive what is said of
himself, although, “peradventure,” not altogether said
with fairness.</p>

PREFACE.
</h2>
</div>
<hr class="short">
<p>There are some people in the world whose pride is
so great or so little, that the remarks of any individual,
respecting their condition, do not affect them
one way or the other. Such a person was Lady
Hester Stanhope; and I beg leave, at the outset of
this work, to apprize the reader, in the most explicit
terms, that I have published nothing, in what I am
about to submit to his perusal, which she would not
have desired to be <em>now</em> made known. As a professional
man, who was for many years her physician,
I may naturally be supposed to feel a deep interest
about her; and, when I had seen her, in the first
epoch of her peregrinations, dwelling in palaces, surrounded
with all the luxuries common to her rank,
and courted and admired by all who had access to
her, I could not but be poignantly affected in beholding
the privations to which she was latterly subjected.
My object being to portray a character which
is not duly appreciated by people in general, I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
devise no better means than that of giving a diary of
her conversations, wherein her observations on men
and things fall naturally from her own mouth.</p>

<p>Whilst I acknowledge my own unfitness for such a
work, my chief reason for undertaking it is the possession
of numerous memoranda, resembling the unfashioned
marble fresh from the quarry, rudely shaped,
but, to the philosopher and moralist, bearing the
marks of the soil from whence it was taken. Had
I entrusted them to abler hands, to form into a
more perfect composition, the materials might have
been embellished, but it would have been at the expense
of their originality.</p>

<p>Lady Hester Stanhope, noble by birth and haughty
by nature, had carried out from England all the habits
of her order: but a prolonged residence in the East
amongst the Turks induced her to reflect on the
different customs of those around her, and she adopted
by degrees all such as she thought had good sense for
their basis. Every year brought her nearer to the
simplicity of nature, and taught her to throw down
those barriers with which pride, reserve, and etiquette
have hedged in persons of rank in this country—barriers,
favourable to a complete separation between the
rich and poor, between the high and low, but which
have also excluded our aristocracy from the enjoyment
of many of the pleasures of life, and have too often made
them the slaves of their own greatness.</p>

<p>The following pages are faithful transcripts of Lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
Hester Stanhope’s conversations. In the thousand
and one nights that I have sat and listened to them,
I have heard enough to compile an uninterrupted
history of her life from her infancy to her death; but,
of course, much has been necessarily suppressed, and
much more forgotten: the reader, therefore, must content
himself with a less continuous narrative, which,
it is hoped, will not prove uninstructive, and is, at all
events, strictly true. The phraseology of the speaker
is religiously preserved, as will be readily acknowledged
by those who have known her. In many
instances it is but little conformable with the present
style of English conversation: but any alterations
made in it, to suit the fastidiousness of some tastes,
would, by destroying the fidelity of the picture, shake
the authenticity of what remains.</p>

<p>I have touched slightly on Lady Hester Stanhope’s
religious opinions; and although I am quite sure that
a traveller was seldom, if ever, allowed to depart from
her presence without an insight into her sentiments
on these points, even from the little I have said,
it will be plain that not one has done her justice in
speaking of them.</p>

<p>I sincerely trust that nothing will be found in the
following pages which can with just cause wound the
feelings of any <em>living</em> person: and it is to be borne in
mind that chagrin and disappointment had soured
Lady Hester’s temper, and put her out of humour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
with all mankind; so that her praise and blame must
be received with all due reservation.</p>

<p>Before I conclude, I think it necessary to add a few
lines respecting the last months of her existence.
Lady Hester Stanhope died, as far as I have been
able to learn, unattended by a single European,
and in complete isolation. I was the last European
physician or medical man that attended her, and
I was most anxious and willing (foreseeing her approaching
fate as I did) to continue to remain with
her: but it was her determined resolve that I should
leave her, and those who have known her can not
deny that opposition to her will was altogether out of
the question.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that, by prolonging my stay on
Mount Lebanon, I might have been of considerable
service to her ladyship. She was about to shut
herself up alone, without money, without books,
without a soul she could confide in; without a single
European, male or female, about her; with winter
coming on, beneath roofs certainly no longer waterproof,
and that might fall in; with war at her doors,
and without any means of defence except in her own
undaunted courage; with no one but herself to carry
on her correspondence; so that everything conspired
to make it an imperative duty to remain with her:
yet she would not allow me to do so, and insisted on
my departure on an appointed day, declaring it to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
her fixed determination to remain immured, as in a
tomb, until reparation had been made her for the
supposed insult she had received at the hands of
the British government.</p>

<p>It would have been expected that the niece of Mr.
Pitt, and the grand-daughter of the great Lord
Chatham, might have laid claim to some indulgence
from those whose influence could help or harm her;
and that her peculiar situation in a foreign country,
among a people unacquainted with European customs
and habits (being left as she was to her own energies
to meet the difficulties which encompassed her), might
have exempted her from any annoyance, if it did not
obtain for her any aid. A woman sixty years old,
with impaired health, inhabiting a spot removed many
miles from any town, amidst a population whom their
own chiefs can hardly keep under control, was no fit
object, one would think, for molestation under any
circumstances; but, when the services of Lady Hester’s
family are put into the scale, it seems wonderful
how the representations of interested money-lenders
could have had sufficient weight with those who guided
the State to induce them to disturb her solitude and
retirement. Will it be believed that, when in August,
1838, I took leave of her, the beam of the ceiling of
the saloon, in which she ordinarily sat, was propped
up by two unsightly spars of wood, for fear the
ceiling should fall on her head; and that these deal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
pillars, very nearly in the rough state in which they
had been brought from the North in some Swedish
vessel, stood in the centre of the room? Her bed-room
was still worse; for there the prop was a rough
unplaned trunk of a poplar-tree, cut at the foot of the
hill on which her own house stood.</p>

<p>It may be asked whether there were no carpenters
or masons in that country? There certainly were
both; but, where carriage is effected on the backs of
camels and mules and there are no wheeled vehicles
whatever, in a sudden emergency (such as the cracking
of a beam), resort must be had to the most ready
expedient for immediate safety; and, with her resources
cramped by the threatened stoppage of her
pension, her ladyship could not venture on new-roofing
her rooms—a work of time and expense.</p>

<p>The perusal of the narrative which is here submitted
to the reader will sufficiently account for Lady
Hester’s debts, and the most cursory visit to her
habitation at Jôon (or Djoun, as the French write it)
would have proved to anybody that the money which
she had borrowed was never expended on <em>her own</em>
comforts:—a tradesman’s wife in London had ten
times as many. Having no other servants but peasants,
although trained by herself, she could scarcely
be said to have been waited on; and a tolerable idea
may be formed of their customary service, when an eyewitness
can say that he has seen a maid ladling water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
out of a cistern with the warming-pan, and a black
slave putting the teapot on the table, holding it by
the spout, and the spout only.</p>

<p>But these were trifles, in comparison with the destruction
and pilfering common to the negresses and
peasant girls; and so little possibility was there of
keeping any article of furniture or apparel for its
destined purpose, that, after many years of ineffectual
trouble, she, who was once, in her attire, the ornament
of a court, might now be said to be worse clad than a
still-room maid in her father’s house. Her ladyship
slept on a mattress, on planks upheld by trestles, and
the carpeting of her bed-room was of felt. She proclaimed
herself, with much cheerfulness, a philosopher;
and, so far as self-denial went, in regard to personal
sumptuousness, her assertion was completely borne
out in garb and furniture. How far she deserved that
title, upon the higher grounds of speculative science
and the extraordinary range of her understanding, let
those say who have shared with the writer in the profound
impression which her conversation always left
on the minds of her hearers.</p>

<p>Peace be with her remains, and honour to her
memory! A surer friend, a more frank and generous
enemy, never trod the earth. “Show me where the
poor and needy are,” she would say, “and let the
rich shift for themselves!” As free from hypocrisy
as the purest diamond from stain, she pursued her
steady way, unaffected by the ridiculous reports that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
were spread about her by travellers, either malicious
or misinformed, and not to be deterred from her noble,
though somewhat Quixotic enterprises, by ridicule or
abuse, by threats or opposition.</p>

<p>I take this opportunity of thanking the Chevalier
Henry Guys, French Consul at Aleppo, for the communication
he so liberally made me of the correspondence
between Lady Hester Stanhope and himself, and
from which I have selected such letters as bore on the
subjects noticed in the diary. The reader will form
the best estimate of that gentleman’s merits from a
perusal of them.</p>

<p class="center small">Introductory remarks—Correspondence.</p>
</div>


<p class="p2">When Lady Hester Stanhope commenced her
travels, in 1810, I accompanied her in the capacity of
physician, until, after many wanderings in the East,
I saw her finally settled on Mount Lebanon; but,
being obliged to return to England for the purpose
of taking my medical degrees at Oxford and
London, after having passed seven years uninterruptedly
in her service, I took leave of her. My successor,
an English surgeon, disliking an Oriental life,
left her, however, at the end of a year or two, and,
at Lady Hester’s request, I again revisited Syria.
But I found that her ladyship had in the mean while
completely familiarized herself with the usages of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
East, conducting her establishment entirely in the
Turkish manner, and adopting even much of their
medical empiricism. Under these circumstances, and
at her own suggestion, I again bade her adieu, as I
then believed, for the last time.</p>

<p>It was my intention to have cultivated my professional
pursuits in London; there were great difficulties
to be overcome—difficulties which have been
ably depicted in the graphic pages of a recent publication.
I did not wait, however, to try the issue of
this slow career. Years of travel had inspired me
with other views; and it was with much secret satisfaction
that I resolved to avail myself of an opportunity
which Lady Hester’s wishes again presented
me, of once more traversing the mountain solitudes of
Syria. It is not altogether an idle tribute of respect
and admiration for her character to say, that the
prospect of resuming my former position afforded me
real pleasure. Long habit had reconciled me to her
eccentricities, and even to her violent and overbearing
temper. I had a profound sense of her exalted nature,
and I felt that her oddities and peculiarities weighed
only with those who knew her merely by common
report, and that they in no respect affected her intrinsic
worth in the estimation of such as were intimately
acquainted with the sterling qualities of her
heart and understanding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
I had been honoured with letters from her, in
which she gave me reason to understand that she
should be gratified by my presence in Syria; and I
promptly expressed my readiness, in reply, to resume
my situation near her person. The long intervals,
however, which elapsed in the transmission of letters,
(sometimes as much as four months) added to the
uncertainty of what I should do, and the absolute
necessity of doing something, induced me, while the
correspondence was pending, to enter into a professional
engagement with a gentleman of rank. When
her anxiety to receive me, therefore, was definitively
conveyed to me, I was placed in the painful dilemma
of being obliged to apologize to her for not being able
at that time to join her. This apology naturally generated
a feeling of distrust in a mind so sensitive
and impulsive—a feeling abundantly exhibited, in
her own peculiar way, in the following extracts from
letters received from her at this period. Some of
these letters were written by herself, and some by her
<i lang="fr">protégée</i> Miss Williams,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> at her dictation.</p>

<cite>Extract of a letter from Lady Hester Stanhope to
Dr. ——.</cite></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right r2">
July 30, 1823.
</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I shall not either scold or reproach you; I only
hope that the line you have taken will turn out in the
end to your advantage. I confess I am sorry and
mortified that, after having rendered me several services,
you are still in a situation so little independent.
Were I inclined to be angry, it would be with ——;
for, had he been like the chevaliers of former times,
he would have said, “Doctor, however it may be inconvenient
for me to part with you at present, I so
much respect your motives, and so much admire your
fidelity, that, so far from opposing, allow me to promote
your views; and I beg you will accept of this
purse for your little wants. When you have finished
with it, I trust you will consider me as your next
friend; and I flatter myself I may expect from you
the same proofs of attachment.”</p>

<p>But the world is spoilt; no good feeling exists; all
is egotism. Had ——’s mind been as elegant as his
horses, carriages, and servants were, when I saw them,
years ago, he would not have acted thus, and taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
advantage of a man’s circumstances, to have made him
act against his inclination.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>I have no right to demand permanent sacrifices of
you or others. The time will come when you will
see with deep regret whether or not I had taken into
consideration your interests as well as my own present
convenience. I was surprised at your offer, so often
repeated, and less surprised at your conduct; as a
doubt often had occurred in my own mind, if temptations
of any kind happened to be thrown in your way,
whether or not you would have strength of mind to
refuse present advantage and comfort. You have
acted as you judged best, and as you thought circumstances
authorized you to do; but you never can persuade
me that General Grenville, the soul of honour
and feeling, could ever have recommended a man to
break his word. Had you simply asked him, before
you had made up your mind, “Shall I keep my word
and go, or accept of those offers? Give me, I do entreat,
your candid opinion:”—I know what it would
have been. But, having decided, what would you
have him say? that I should be angry? No: he
knew me too well not to be aware that no sacrifice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
which I did not believe to be a voluntary one, could
have any value in my estimation.</p>

<p>I cannot explain my feelings without seeming to
praise myself. I make one rule for my own line of
conduct, and one for that of others, and have two
separate judgments; I mean, one regulated by truth
and feeling, and one after the fashion of what is
thought right in the world. I never judge myself and
those I really love by the latter. I wish them to be
pure and highminded, and to have confidence in God’s
mercy, if they act from true principle. But you
worldly slaves of <i lang="fr">bon ton</i> must not be tried by such a
test. Mr. Murray<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> was right—“She will not be
angry,”—no, because she thinks you all children:
I mean the gay world, of which you now make a
part.</p>

<p>I need not have said all this, but it is a hint as to
the future, when the folly and uselessness of modern
ideas and calculations will be at an end. I have been
thought mad—ridiculed and abused; but it is out of
the power of man to change my way of thinking upon
any subject. Without a true faith, there can be no
true system of action. All the learned of the East
pronounce me to be a <dfn>Ulemah min Allah</dfn>,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> as I can
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>neither write nor read; but my reasoning is profound
according to the laws of Nature.</p>

<p>I shall say nothing of this part of the world, where
I had latterly announced your speedy arrival to some
of my particular friends and to my family.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Your
interest about matters here must now be at an end;
and it fatigues me so to write, that, without it is a
case of absolute necessity, I must give it up. I have
no assistance. My two dragomans are low-minded,
curious, vulgar men, in whom I can put no confidence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
In short, they can only be called very bad, idle servants,
having no one property of a gentleman belonging
to them.</p>

<p>James’s loss,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the general’s death—all has afflicted
me beyond description. I heard of James’s affliction
six months after. To write, not to write—no proper
conveyance—what to say—after a year, perhaps, to
open the wounds of his heart without being able to
pour in one drop of the balm of consolation! What
I say would be vain. He considers me as a sort of
poor mad woman, who has once loved him; therefore,
he is kind to me: but as to my opinions having
weight—no! To be considered as a sort of object
is not flattering; but so let it be. There is no
remedy for it, or other evils, except in the hand of
God, which, if he will stretch forth to save me, all
may vanish; if not, I shall vanish; for I am quite
worn out.</p>

<p>You will probably never receive the letter I alluded
to, enclosed to a <em>person</em>. They must have heard of
your conduct, and therefore think it unnecessary to
see you, or give you the letter. Why did you inquire
about this? What a simpleton you are! But there
it all ends: there will be no more jumbles to make.
Perhaps you may not hear from me, or of me, for years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
Remember, I shall give no opinion about you to any
one; therefore, do not fancy, if you see a change in
people’s conduct, it comes from me. The world and
fashionable loungers take up new favourites every day,
and discard the old ones without reason. All are not
General Grenvilles. No one so likely to be mortified
at this as you.</p>

<p>Why do you not talk to me of James’s poor little
children, and why not have asked to see them? Have
you forgotten how all about him interests me? I fear
folly and fashion have got hold of you....</p>

</div><!--end letter-->

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the year 1826, my professional engagements with
the honourable individual before alluded to having
ceased, I made the necessary preparations for my departure
from England. Lady Hester Stanhope’s situation,
feelings, and intentions at this precise time, will
be best understood from three long letters which she
wrote on three successive days of January, 1827, the
very month in which I set out, but which I did not
receive until the July following, at Pisa. To make
the contents of these letters intelligible, it is necessary
to premise that a traveller, whom we will designate as
Mr. X., had, during a visit to her ladyship, at her
residence, insinuated himself into her confidence so far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
as to make her believe that he was sent by the Duke
of Sussex and the Duke of Bedford, and a committee
of other influential Freemasons, to inquire into her
wants, and to offer her such sums of money out of their
funds as would extricate her from her pecuniary difficulties.
How she could believe in such a gross tissue
of falsehoods it is difficult to imagine, unless we are to
suppose that Mr. X. was himself the dupe of others,
who, for some sinister purpose, had furnished him with
papers and documents so apparently authentic as to
impose even upon Lady Hester Stanhope’s wonted
sagacity.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p class="p2 center"><cite>Lady Hester Stanhope to Dr. ——.</cite></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right r2">
Djoun, January 5, 1827.
</p>

<p class="indent2">My dear Doctor,</p>

<p class="indent5">I will not afflict you by drawing a picture
of my situation, or of the wretched scarecrow
grief and sickness have reduced me to; but I must
tell you that I am nearly blind, and this is probably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
the last letter I shall be able to write to you: indeed,
no other will be necessary.</p>

<p>I have received your letters of September the 17th
and October the 18th of last year. What tricks
played upon me, who have sacrificed everything to
what I thought right! X., upon his arrival here, gave
out to everybody, a month before I saw him, that he
was the bearer of important letters from persons of the
first consequence, and that he was sent to see into and
settle my affairs. When he presented himself to me,
he said that <i>B.</i> wrote to him to go to Syria, and <i>Aug.</i>
sent him, and that his expenses were defrayed by the
<i>Sharky</i>, and that everything would be as I could wish,
and more than I could wish; at least, as far as I had
expressed. As for his having become guarantee for
my debts, or having advanced me £1400, with the
promise shortly of £5000 more, it is all pure invention.
He <em>did</em> say that he had written to order a box
of jewels, worth 20, or 25,000 piasters, to be sent to a
merchant here, to be sold on my account: and he said
also he should send a letter of credit from Constantinople
for 100 purses, for me to go on with until an
express could arrive from England. The money he
was to draw from his mercantile house; and he told
me I need not be uneasy about it, as he should be paid
instantly upon his arrival in England. He talked
about its being his duty, &amp;c. I certainly believed all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
this, but have never seen a farthing. What he said
to your friend, Mr. Vondiziano, of Cyprus, I know
not; but Mr. V. offered to send me 2000 dollars,
which I accepted, and gave a note for six months, as
desired, and the time of payment is now nine months
past. X. moreover assured me, that in England
nothing had been well understood, excepting only that
all was wonder and approbation. He said that he
should return here with all that I wanted, and should
bring with him bricklayers, carpenters, &amp;c., to enlarge
my house and premises, as many great people would
be coming who were anxious to see me: so that not a
ship appears in sight but poor and rich fly to the seaside,
shout and bare their heads, praying that it may
be my ship; for all know my distress, and that I shall
live upon charity. According to the ideas of the East,
they expect to see a great box of money, left me by
my brother, and the contents of his store-room, and
all his pots and pans. It would not, therefore, be
prudent for X. to return here. He would fare ill, and
I should not know what to say. Should he arrive, I
shall not see him; for he must be either a spy, a
swindler, or a scapegoat for lies; and none of these
characters do I wish to have anything to do with.</p>

<p>Poor Williams knows nothing of all this, except
that I am in debt, and in expectation of money which
is to come; for X. told everybody so: but she is at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
times uneasy about the future, and so on. All is
right with her: she is strictly honest, but ignorant,
having been a spoiled child, doing only what she
thought proper, and never having learned household
affairs. Yet, had she not been here, everything
would have been much worse; as all, you know, are
thieves, or wasteful, destroying beasts, unthankful,
improvident, and whom it is impossible to teach any
thing, or to make listen to reason or common sense.</p>

<p>Write to <i>B.</i>, or call upon him until you see him.
Do not give it up; but, until you have seen him, say
not a word of my letters to any one. Let <i>B.</i> take
notes, and speak to <i>Aug.</i>—not you. Let prudence
and silence be the order of the day with you, and even
with the <i>Sharky</i> of all nations you sometimes dine
with. <i>B.</i> is a pure one, by birthright. I believe X.
has acted by command, like others; therefore, in my
heart, I am not angry with him; yet I will not see
him.</p>

<p>Now, here are my orders and ultimatum. We will
suppose two cases. If X.’s story is true, and my
debts, amounting to £10,000, or nearly, are to be
paid, then I shall go on making sublime and philosophical
discoveries, and employing myself in deep,
abstract studies; although, as my strength is gone, I
cannot work day and night, as I have done. In that
case, I shall want a mason, a carpenter, a ploughman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
a gardener, groom, cowman, doctor, &amp;c.; so that I
must have assistance: income made out, £4000 a
year, and £1000 more, for persons like you, that I
should want, and £5000 ready money, for provisions,
building, animals, money in hand, &amp;c., that I may
start clear. In the second case, in the event that all
that has been told me is a lie, then let me be disowned
publicly, now and hereafter, and left to my fate and
faith alone: for, if I have not a right to what I want,
which is in the hands of Messrs. Sharky and Co., I
will have nothing. Nothing else will I hear of; and
grief has departed from my soul since I have taken
the following resolution.</p>

<p>I shall give up everything for life, that I may now
or hereafter possess in Europe, to my creditors, and
throw myself as a beggar upon Asiatic humanity, and
wander far without one <i>para</i> in my pocket, with the
mare from the stable of Solomon in one hand, and a
sheaf of the corn of <i>Beni-Israel</i> in the other. I
shall meet death, or that which I believe to be written,
which no mortal hand can efface. There is nothing
else to be done. I shall wait for no dawdling letters,
or fabrication of lies, of which, for these five years, I
have had enough. The will of God be done! I shall
cheerfully follow my fate, and defy them all. For
what are they without me? In the long run, they
will see. But I have too lofty a soul not to observe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
the strictest line of honour towards even my enemies.</p>

<p>Dear little Adams! I have never written to that
<dfn>joher</dfn>;<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> but all the past is written in my heart. I
only waited till the cloud of my misery had dispersed,
to let him know I was not ungrateful. Should it
please God to deliver me out of the hands of my
cruel brethren, as Joseph was delivered, then he will
know—and you will know—what are my feelings of
gratitude. Forgive me, forgive me, if I have injured
you involuntarily! Oh! my God! perhaps, I have
been the cause of your ruin. I have wept and wept;
but tears will not feed the little children. Alas! my
only trust is in Heaven.</p>

<p>You meant to do well, so I will not scold: but
why apply without leave to the <em>Fat</em> or the <em>Thin</em>, or
why talk to —— of my concerns? What is —— to
me? I never could endure him. I know him well—a
low-minded, chitter-chattering fellow: but suppose
him an angel, had you my leave to consult or speak
to him?—it is not likely. But, in the event of the
<em>Fat</em> or the <em>Thin’s</em> having placed any money in the
hands of my bankers, let them take it back again....
You have no explanations to make, only that I decline
it. Under no circumstances, I repeat, will I owe
any obligation to the <em>Fat</em>, to the <em>Thin</em>, to Canning,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>or his friends, or have anything to do with Sir Vanity.
I say this, as I have heard of new plans of his. He
may perhaps mean to come here;—if to-morrow, I
shall shut my door in his face. If any force, consular
force, is ever tried with me, I shall use force in return,
and appeal to the populace to defend me. It is right
this should be known. I am no slave, and I disown
all such authority. Never will I be brought to
England but in chains, and never will I be made to
act differently from that which my will dictates,
whilst there is breath in my body: therefore, to
attempt to oppose me is vain. I am up to all their
tricks, and it is time there should be an end of them.</p>

<p>If —— calls, say you have had a letter, in which
I express my great astonishment that you should
have spoken to him of my affairs, as they do not concern
him in any way, and that I insist upon it that
you should be perfectly silent in future; so he must
not take it ill. Tell him that, strange to say, I decline
all assistance from my family—persons, whom
I have had no communication with for years, or ever
shall have; and if he asks what I am to do, say you
don’t know—that she knows best. I fear by and by
that everything will be in the newspapers. These
sort of men talk before servants to show their importance;
all goes to grooms, footmen, and coachmen.
I have traced all that before. One would think you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
were mad to forget all I have said to you on those
subjects.</p>

<p>Grieve not about me—I am without fear and without
reproach. My mind is a Paradise, since I have
cast all that botheration from me: it is full of sublime
ideas and knowledge. Write no more. I want
nothing, and shall be off as soon as the fine weather
comes, unless it should please God to <i>eftah bab el
khyr</i>, [to open the door to good fortune]; otherwise,
I shall burn all, and send Williams to Malta, with a
note to be paid the first when Lady Bankes dies; for
I have never paid her expenses here to Mr. David.
Adieu, God bless you!</p>

<p>PS.—There is another letter at your friend’s in
the city, which goes by this conveyance, and a note
in it for ——. Puff! upon the £800. I spit upon
it, and as many thousands from the same quarter.
Are you mad? No, but I, in misfortune as in
prosperity, am unlike the rest of the world; and
I shall give sufficient proof that I defy it altogether.</p>

Djoun, January 6, 1827.
</p>

<p>I have received your letters of the 17th September
and 18th of October of last year safe. You will
inquire for a letter of mine directed to Coutts’s, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
not in my hand; and do not say it came from me.
Say nothing to any one of having received this,
until you have well conned over the other: then go
to B., insist upon seeing him, saying it is of the
utmost importance. The note, which I told you in
my letter of yesterday would be enclosed in this,
I have burnt, for fear of accidents. Notwithstanding,
in the event of my being mistaken, in order that
all may be clear to you, I have sent you enclosed
more notes. In the letter of the 5th you will find
my ultimate resolves. I hope and trust not in them.</p>

<p>I have read over your letters again. Never did I
tell X. to ask for a place, or recommend him, more
than saying he had acted generously and kindly by
me, which I then believed.</p>

<p>As for my debts, it is not, as you think, 25 per
cent. yearly that I have to pay, but 50 and 95,
and, in one instance, I have suffered more loss still.
Gold of 28½ piasters they counted to me here at 45,
which I spent at 28½, and am to repay at Beyrout
at the rate of 45—calculate that. I was compelled to
borrow; for I can’t eat silk, and that is all that is to
be found here. Had those, who ought, then given a
clear answer, things would not have been thus: but
so it is written; I was to be a beggar. Be it so!
All situations have their blessings, with the grace of
God; it is uncertainty which is torture: but now my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
mind is made up. I have saved a <dfn>mid</dfn><a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> of the corn
of the <i>Beni-Israel</i>, having no more land to sow.
When in ear, ripe or not ripe, I shall cut it and be
off, and give up my present and future income to my
creditors for my life. Perhaps they may gain two
hundred per cent.</p>

<p>Should the other letter be lost, burn this; hold
your tongue, and say you have not heard from me;
for this is of no use without the other, which contains
full explanations, and for which reason you may be
commanded to say that you have not heard from me.
The loss will change nothing. I shall follow my fate,
and be far off, I hope, before new lies arrive.</p>

<p>Not that I credit any change,—but, in case of
a happy turn of events, I have said all this to
provide for all cases, that you may not be embarrassed
how to act. But I have little or no hope.
I am no dupe to the tricks played me; who could
be, who had one grain of common sense? A child
of seven years old, well brought up, must at once
see how unlikely—how impossible—it was that I
should have applied for money to those who, from
the hour I have first known them, have been themselves
involved, or to that <em>one</em><a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> whom admiration and
respect give me confidence in, and not intimacy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
How could any human being credit that, with my
independent character, I could stoop to receive one
farthing from relations who have behaved to me like
mine ..., and who, for years and years, have
been upon the footing of strangers?</p>

<p>What an affliction to me is the sad news you wrote!
Poor dear angel! what a heart! May he inhabit the
seventh heaven!<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>I have been very ill of a terrible fever and strong
convulsions. I tell you this that the period may not
be mistaken, and my pension stopped. My eyes are
quite dim, and drawn into my head with contraction,
which sometimes pulls my head back—quite back.
I can hardly crawl; but yet, poor monster as I
am, I shall get on: for my spirit and heart are
unchanged.</p>

<p>Now for servants. In the event of things having
taken a favourable turn, and of their giving you the
money necessary, I shall want no women until I have
seen you first, and heard about them, for they might
not answer. Men I should want as you will find
described below, but no man-servant for the house—they
are quite useless; never can one give a pipe, or
present himself, and always out of temper with his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
room, food, &amp;c. All those who come may go back in
the Turkish year 45. Do not forget to make that remark
to B., but to no one else.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

MEN-SERVANTS.
</p>

<p>The great object would be a storekeeper to lock up,
weigh, measure, and write down everything that comes
in or goes out. Strict honesty, activity, and good
character, are most necessary. Perhaps one of the
sons of my old wet-nurse, Mrs. T., might answer better
than anybody else, as I should feel sure of their
attachment and principles. Mr. Murray knows and
likes her, and might make that inquiry; and, indeed,
there may be a girl in the family that might suit me,
or a grandchild of the eldest daughter—the more like
the mother, my nurse, the better; for she was a most
charming and valuable creature, the happiest temper
under the sun. It would not be a vulgar place for the
son, because he would have a strong <dfn>fellah</dfn> [peasant]
under him, to lift, and carry, and expose the stores to
the air: he should write a good hand, and be able to
keep accounts: his place would be like that of a purser
in a ship. In one of the great revolutions, about five
years ago, when I was eaten up by those who fled
to me for succour, there went, in less than a year,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>thirty-six <i>garáras</i> of wheat,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> fifty of barley, and four
and a half cwt. of butter, with everything else in
proportion.</p>

<p>The second man must be an old dragoon to overlook
<dfn>sayses</dfn> [grooms]: one out of Lord Cathcart’s regiments
would be best, because they are all polite. My lord
is of the old school, and his men have a fine, imposing
appearance. He must be spirited, though cool; for
hasty people will not do with these beasts. General
Taylor, if you asked him, would understand best what
I mean.</p>

<p>Next, I must have a Scotch gardener, a quiet, steady,
and retired character, yet active and intelligent, understanding
the culture of flowers and garden-stuff in a
common way, and capable of being a sort of bailiff, to
choose land, prune trees, plough, sow, and lay out
grounds. He should bring with him all sorts of proper
utensils—a plough, a harrow, &amp;c.; seeds, roots—and
be ingenious enough to make a little model for this,
and a little model for that. These three will be sufficient;
for all waiting-servants and house-servants are
useless.</p>

<p>I want a maid-servant for myself; not a fine lady,
but one who has been a nursery or housemaid; one by
nature above her situation, about eighteen, twenty, or
twenty-two years of age, proper or not proper all the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>same, with a most excellent character. Don’t employ
fifty persons about it. The Scotch lady, who was so
good to Lucy, perhaps would know such a one—I mean
one who has natural sense, feeling, a good heart and
person, but no boarding-school miss—for education of
all things is most odious.</p>

<p>Then I must have one for housekeeper, knowing
about a dairy, all sorts of bread, pastry, and preserves,
and not mild, but faithful.</p>

<p>Now, you have heard me a thousand times say
what are good and what are bad marks; but, as
you have a horrid memory, I will add a few observations.</p>

<p>Wrinkles at the eyes are abominable, and about
the mouth. Eyebrows making one circle, if meeting,
or close and straight, are equally bad. Those are
good meeting the line of the nose, as if a double
bridge. Eyes long, and wide between the eyebrows;
and no wrinkles in the forehead when they laugh,
or about the mouth, are signs of bad luck and duplicity.
Eyes all zigzag are full of lies. A low,
flat forehead is bad; so are uneven eyes, one larger
than the other, or in constant motion. I must have
a fine, open face, all nature, with little education, in
a fine, straight, strong, healthy person, with a sweet
temper.</p>

<p>Did you ever see a picture or painting of the Lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
William Russell, the duke’s brother’s wife? that
sort of face was perfect for a woman. If the eyebrows
of a <em>man</em> are straight, and come nearly together,
that is nothing; but, if they form an arch, it is
always a sign of natural <em>hum</em> [melancholy or gloominess]
in character. Never can such a one be contented
or happy. Look at little Adams and General
Taylor—how sincere are their black eyebrows!</p>

<p>Don’t make a mistake—wrinkles of age are not the
wrinkles of youth, of which I am speaking. One
line is not called a wrinkle. The wrinkles I speak
of are found in children of seven years old when they
laugh or cry.</p>

<p>The foot should be hollow and not flat. Club-feet
stand good with all men and women. Legs that kick
up dust when they walk, or a heavy walk, are bad.
Stumpy hands are not good. Very white skin is not
good; the yellow-white is better, and the veins
should appear in the arms and wrists. An offensive,
snapping voice, and awkward, snatching fingers, are
bad; as is affectation of all sorts—bad teeth, unclean
tongue and mouth, and bad smells about the person.
Shun dry, crabbed dispositions, masked with smiles
and gentleness; as also the officious and fidgety, the
curious and intriguing, the discontented, and those
with no feeling, or feeling false taught.</p>

To this letter is appended a page of Arabic, written
in English characters, which Lady Hester considered
would be intelligible to me, accustomed as I was to
her manner of speaking that language: but it is questionable
whether any other person, however well
acquainted with Arabic, would be able to make out
her meaning. I shall beg leave, therefore, to omit

</p>

<p>Besides this, there is a letter addressed to Grosvenor
Square, and one to the Strand. Do not own
any of the three from me until you have read them
all over, and made notes of what concerns me and
my affairs. Communicate everything, as I desire you,
to B., to <i>Aug.</i>, and not to any one else at present,
unless ordered by him.</p>

<p>Say not a word to X. until all is settled, one way
or another. Then, before B., ask him these questions:
Did not you say you had been the travelling-companion
to B.’s son W., and had been like a child
of the family?—Did not you show a present from
<i>Aug.</i>, saying, in case of accidents, that was a passport
<i lang="fr">partout</i>, and that money would be given you, if
required, when that was seen?—Did not you show a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
paper, in a red box, as your grand credentials from the
house of Sharka and Co.?—Did not you give a good
reason for not being the bearer of private letters from
<i>Aug.</i>, B., and others?—Did not you say that all
were mere dunces in comparison with <i>Kokub</i>? But
all is trick. The poor devil, I believe, was given
<i lang="fr">carte blanche</i> to lie, provided he could spy—perhaps
from another quarter?</p>

<p>Oh! odious ——! For God’s sake, keep clear of
him! What has such a fellow to do with me, or my
concerns? He has ever been a meddler and mischief-maker,
and for these twenty years I have had no
communication with him. By what law of God or
man, are you bound to answer people’s questions?—the
lowest and most vulgar of proceedings. I have
told you so for years and years. What had he
to do with the coming or going of X.? and what
sort of a fellow is X., to have thus made public my
affairs?</p>

<p>Of the assistance of the <em>Fat</em> or <em>Thin</em> I will not
hear. The last I have had no communication with
for twenty years and more, and the other I cannot
respect. Heber has grieved me, for I once thought
better of him. He has, at times, made offers of
service in a vague way, just to say he had made
them; but, if sincere, he would have written—“You
have lost a friend; perhaps your presence may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
required in England, to put your affairs to rights;
therefore, I have placed so-and-so at Coutts’s, ready
for your journey, which, if not necessary, let me have
the consolation of thinking, may add to your little
comforts.” I should not have accepted anything,
but yet should have thought it necessary to have
thanked him, which I have not done for nonsensical
speeches. I feel that I have no friend left in Europe;
all are gone. Yet Allah mojôod [God is with me],
and that is enough.</p>

<p>Speaking to little <i>A.</i> was proper; but, to all others,
oh, what folly! You are no chitter-chatterer by
nature, but your vanity makes you so. Why did
I never speak to you of sublime things?—because
I feared your prudence. You used sometimes to
say—I have been asked so and so, sometimes so
extraordinary. Poh! poh! stuff! are you a fool?
do hold your tongue. Those <em>hums</em> and <em>hahs</em> were
only distant hints: had you heard more, you would
have gone mad. Not so me: I am all composure;
haughty before men, but humble in spirit, like the
<i>Nebby Daôod</i> [the prophet David], before the wise
dispenser of <i>hum</i> and <i>khyr</i> [of sorrow and joy].</p>

<p>Do you think that misery will make me crouch, or
beg of those who have no heart? If I beg, it will be
of the followers of Omar and Ali, whose creed is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
generosity; and the good amongst them never even
wound an unfortunate being, by making him retail
his misfortunes.</p>

<p>Since my mind has been made up, I am not low,
but feeble, and almost blind with a sort of violent
muscular contraction, which has drawn my eyes into
my head, and sometimes has distorted all my body:
but my body is nothing; the heart is as full of fire
as ever. I cannot read what I have written. I was
two days making out your last letters. I had prepared
a little court, with two rooms and an open
divan, for you; but, with Mrs. —— and the children,
it will not do. I shall love her and the dear children
much, and all might be comfortable. God grant it so!
I have a house in the village, which is good, and will
do very well—clean, with two rooms up-stairs. If
things were to turn out well, I should quickly build
apartments close to the house, which would be near
and convenient. But what do I say? All my plans
are overturned; and, although in spirits at the idea of
shortly getting away from all I have to go through,
I am miserable that that cheat X. did not perfectly
explain about your letter enclosed in <i>Aug.’s</i>. What
will you do?</p>

<p>Well, now I have said enough, and must make up
my mind to have, in a few days, an attack, from overstraining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
my head and eyes: but it is the last effort of
the nature I shall make. Adieu.</p>

<p>PS. A dun, who came here two months ago—a
Christian—took a Turk into his room, after I had
seen and spoken to him, and said—“I came to get
my money, but now I am ready to cry at her situation.
It is clear that those Franks are unprincipled
and unfeeling, that they have no religion, and know
not God. The proof is—and does there want a
stronger?—their leaving such a wonderful person as
she really is to wither with sorrow.” Then he went
out swearing, and took his leave. These are the feelings
now alive among the Turkish population. As a
contrast, mark how Mr. ——, an Englishman, acts.
He told one of my creditors to take my bond, put it in
water, and, when well sopped, to drink the mixture;
“for that is all,” said he, “you will ever get for it.”
Furious was the creditor, and took himself off to a
distance, but will in a few months be back again to
torment me.</p>

 Miss Williams was a young Englishwoman, who had been
brought up in Mr. Pitt’s family, and who had all along resided
with Lady Hester Stanhope, as her humble companion. It is
necessary to observe that it was a common custom with Lady
Hester, when she had any particular object in view, to write
one version of the subject with her own hand, and to dictate
another, which was to be considered as the expression of the
opinions of the writer, but which to me, long habituated to the
secrets of her cabinet, was easily recognized as emanating from
one and the same source.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a>
 In justice to the honourable individual here alluded to, it

 Lady Hester does not here mean her relations in England.
She had another family, adopted by her, in Arabia—the tribe
of Arabs called the <dfn>Koreysh</dfn>. And, as many individuals, both
among the green-turbaned Mussulmans, or <dfn>Sheryfs</dfn>, as they
are called, the recognized descendants of Mahomet, and among
the gentry of Syria who claim alliance with the noble tribes of
the desert, were in the habit of frequent intercourse with her,
it is to these she probably had announced my expected coming.
She had a notion, founded on a very doubtful etymology, that
the first Lord Chatham was descended from an Arabian stock,
there being a tribe somewhat similar in name still existing
among the Bedouins. How she could forget that Pitt was the
family name, and Chatham a title of dignity, superimposed, is
not clear. But from this tribe of Arabs sprung Melek Seyf, a
great conqueror; and, reasoning in this way, Melek Seyf was
her ancestor, as tribes, like clans, are all one blood. This story,
repeated over and over again, became current among the servants
and in the villages; and the maids were accustomed to
say, “Yes, my lady, they may be princes or emperors who
come to see you, but your descent is higher than theirs—your
ancestors were Melek Seyf, and the seven kings.”</p>

<p class="p2">On the 23rd of January, 1827, I crossed over to
Calais with my family. Here the severity of the
weather and the sale of some landed property in England
detained us until the 9th of May, when we prosecuted
our journey to Paris, Lausanne, and Pisa,

<p class="indent2">Dear Doctor,</p>

<p class="indent5">You will hear from Mr. Webb the situation
I am in. I sent three letters to you, by way of
France, at the beginning of the year. To cut the
matter short, it is better to say you never received
them. If any one asks after X., say you don’t know
him, or otherwise you will be so teazed with questions.
Mind these instructions. Say to everybody, when you
land, that you know nothing of my affairs, not having
seen any of my family since my brother’s death;<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> that,
hearing I had a complaint in my eyes, you set off,
without consulting any one, and that it was your intention
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>to remain some time with me, as you had brought
Mrs. —— and the children.</p>

<p>Land, if possible, at Sayda, and, on reaching the
harbour, leave your family in the ship, take an ass at
my farrier’s, and come here to Djoun. This is all, I
believe, that is necessary for me to say, should you not
have received my letters, written at the beginning of
the year. If you have received them, and things do
well, the case is rather altered.</p>

<p>I cannot express my gratitude. May God reward
you hereafter!</p>

<p>I hope Mrs. ——- has plenty of rings on her fingers,
as that is very necessary in this country, and the
greatest of possible ornaments in the eyes of women.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>No eligible opportunity offered for sailing until the
end of August, when, having concluded an agreement
with the owners of a merchant brig, we betook ourselves
to Leghorn, and set sail in the Fortuna, Lupi
master, for Cyprus, on the 7th of September, 1827.
There were four Franciscan friars passengers besides
ourselves, bound to the Holy Land, with money annually
sent from some of the Italian states for the
maintenance of the sacred places.</p>

<p>On the 15th of September, being about thirty leagues
from the island of Candia, a tall-masted schooner was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
seen bearing down upon us, and was soon recognized
as a Greek. On nearing us, she hoisted Greek colours,
and ran under our stern, presenting a formidable battery
of twelve guns, with the heads of sixty or eighty
fierce-featured fellows eyeing us over the gunwale. A
scaramouch-looking mate hailed us in good Italian, and
ordered our captain to hoist out his boat and come on
board. Whilst the boat was getting ready, our captain
told us to do the best we could for ourselves, for
that he had no doubt we should be plundered. “As
for you,” he added, addressing himself to me, “make
yourself as smart as you can, assume an air of authority,
and pass yourself off as a consul.” We were all
greatly alarmed. I hastened to follow the captain’s
advice, whilst the friars were busy in stuffing their
gold, their watches, and their small valuables, into
their under-garments and other hiding-places.</p>

<p>The Greeks, however, gave us little time; for, in a
quarter of an hour, fifteen or twenty were on board,
headed by their lieutenant. On getting over the side,
he advanced towards me, and, in a very civil way, told
me that, as Cyprus was blockaded, and as our vessel
was bound to that place, no doubt with succours to
the Turks in some shape or other, his captain found
himself under the disagreeable necessity of taking
possession of the cargo. “You,” he added, “being an
Englishman, will meet with no molestation; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
English are our friends, and we are not incapable of
gratitude.”</p>

<p>In an instant the hatches were forced open; and, as
quick as stout shoulders and tackles could do it, the
Greeks hoisted upon deck, and cut or broke open every
bale, cask, or case that was in the hold, whilst the
lieutenant, holding the bill of lading in his hand,
noted off every one according to its mark. I had
various articles of luggage, and as each was hoisted
up, I had to say it was mine, when it was put aside
on the quarter-deck. The same was done with the
effects of the friars. Each launch-load of goods that
was sent off to the schooner brought back a launch-load
of stout Greeks, who, with hammers and hatchets,
broke down the wainscoting, cut through the ceiling,
searched the berths, and left not a single cranny of the
vessel unransacked.</p>

<p>When the cargo was out, the lieutenant summoned
the four, as I supposed, poor friars to the quarter-deck,
and told them their trunks must next undergo an examination.
Each trunk had a cross on its lid. What
was my surprise when, on opening them, the Greeks
found fifty or sixty pounds of chocolate, bottles of rum
and rosolio, hams, tongues, Bologna sausages, sugar,
and a large box of sugared almonds; also seven or eight
veils, (such as are worn in the Levant) for women, fine
flannel waistcoats and drawers, good calico shirts, &amp;c.;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
200 Venetian ducats, three or four rouleaus of doubloons,
and 5,000 Spanish dollars. The way in which
the Greek sailors scrambled for the sugared almonds
was really quite laughable, making a strange contrast
to the ruin they were perpetrating at the moment on
these inoffensive individuals; but, when they discovered
the money, amounting in all, with what was
taken from the friars’ persons, to no less than 14,000
dollars, they set up a shout, which so effectually
frightened the poor friars, that they fell down on their
knees, and invoked all the saints in the calendar to
their aid. But the cupidity of the Greeks was excited
rather than satisfied by the sight of so much gold and
silver, and they immediately proceeded to strip their
victims, an office which they performed with greater
agility than could have been exhibited by the most
expert valet. This humiliating operation disclosed
fresh booty; the capacious sleeves, drawers, and
hoods, all afforded something. One had a repeater-watch,
and all had money.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there were a few casks of wine in the
hold, which the Greeks tapped; and thus, becoming
intoxicated in the midst of their pillage, a few of the
most ferocious proposed beating the captain to make
him confess if there was more money concealed. They
accordingly gave him some very hard blows with a
rope’s end; then they served the cabin-boy in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
same manner (as being generally privy to the captain’s
hiding-places), and then two sailors. Lastly came the
mate’s turn. Him they bound with a cord, and beat
severely; and, finding blows made them confess
nothing, they dragged him to the gunwale, held his
head over the side of the ship, and, one putting a
knife across his throat, swore he would kill them instantly,
if he did not disclose where the captain’s
money was hid, as well as Turkish letters, which
were conveyed in the brig. The poor man, with loud
cries, appealed to me to save his life; and, whilst I
addressed myself to the lieutenant, Mrs. ——, who was
sitting on the quarter-deck with our little girl, an
infant, in her arms, rushed forward, undismayed by
the ferocious looks of the Greeks, and, with more
than a woman’s courage, arrested the pirate’s arm,
and implored him to spare his victim. Whether it
was their intention to murder the mate it is impossible
to say; but the man who held the knife let
him go, and threw the key of the mate’s chest at
Mrs. ——’s feet.</p>

<p>This scene being over, the lieutenant informed me
that he was bound to examine my luggage, whispering
to me, at the same time, that, as his men had become
very riotous, it would be prudent to propitiate them by
a present of a few dollars. I gladly took his advice,
and presented them with twenty dollars, which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
accepted thanklessly enough. My luggage was then
overhauled; but they took nothing, although, amongst
other things, they were grievously tempted by discovering
a bag of dollars. In the confusion which
ensued I lost only a few trifles. The lieutenant
begged a pair of pantaloons, which I gave him, and
other things, which I assured him I could not spare,
and which he very obligingly allowed me to retain.
Considering that we were wholly in his power, I had
reason to be grateful for his forbearance.</p>

<p>But let me, as an act of justice, bear witness to the
wrongs which this nation, in the regeneration of its
liberties, had to endure, and none of which were
greater than those inflicted by the Austrian and Sardinian
navies, whose flag our vessel bore. Whenever
the merchant-ships of these two powers appeared in
the Levant, it was, under the cloak of trade, to transport
materials of war to their mortal enemies the
Turks; and whenever the injured Greeks, availing
themselves of the rights of nations, molested these pretended
neutrals in their unjust traffic, the Austrian
ships of war made cruel reprisals on them. In the
German war, about the middle of the last century,
when the Dutch, calling themselves neutrals, became
carriers for the enemies of England, we were accused
of committing piratical enormities on the Dutch, equal
to any that the Greeks are charged with, and we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
sought our justification in the same rights: so that
we may ask if the laws of blockade are to be held
good only when exercised by the hands of the
strong? In excuse for beating the master and mate, it
may be alleged, that the Genoese crews, when they
had the mastery, were not backward in using
the same violence. As for the money which was
transferred on this occasion, all that need be said
is, that, setting aside the question of piracy, it
passed from the hands of those who had made a vow
of poverty into the pockets of an oppressed people,
whose families had been driven from their homes,
and perhaps were starving, until some son or husband
could bring them the fruits of their dangerous
enterprises.</p>

<p>Piracy on the high seas, in the open day, has something
very awful and formidable in it. You seem to
be utterly defenceless in the midst of the wide ocean,
with the arbitrators of your destiny standing there to
hurl you, if you utter a murmur, into the fathomless
deep. They demand your money, your goods, or
whatever else may chance to excite their cupidity, and
you give up everything with as smiling a face as you
can. You offer them refreshments, as if they were
welcome guests, who have honoured and delighted you
by their presence; and, until they burst out into the
frantic delirium of drunkenness or butchery, the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
scene wears the appearance of the visit of an obliging
consignee, who has come to take possession of his
property.</p>

<p>At seven at night the schooner’s crew left us to
pursue our voyage. The beds and blankets that lay
scattered on the cabin-floor were replaced in the berths,
a little order was restored, and a wretched supper was
made on hard biscuit and cold water; for everything
good to eat, from the chickens down to the lemons,
walnuts, figs, raisins, &amp;c., had either been taken away
or devoured. It was calm through the night; and,
when the morning of Sunday broke, the schooner was
still in view. Our fears were revived, when we saw
the enemy’s boat manned, and soon afterwards coming
towards us. But it was only a complimentary visit
from the lieutenant, who, with smiles and an amiability
that only a Greek can put on towards those whom he
has plundered, expressed his hopes that we had passed
the night comfortably, and begged of the master to
have the goodness to look for a box of jewels that was
marked on the ship’s bill of lading, but which had
been overlooked the day before; for the lieutenant
spoke and read Italian perfectly, and was supposed to
be a native of the Ionian isles: so that, having examined
the manifest during the night, he was enabled
to discover what valuables there were on board which
had escaped personal scrutiny. The master reluctantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
gave up the casket; and the lieutenant, having requested
him to prick down on the chart the longitude
and latitude, to see if they corresponded with his own
reckoning, politely took his leave, squeezing my hand
on parting, just as if we had been old acquaintances
bidding each other adieu. A breeze sprang up; the
schooner put her head towards Candia, and we soon
lost sight of her.</p>

<p>A council was then called as to what was to be done.
The friars, who had lost their all, were for putting
back: but I objected to that course, seeing we were
now two-thirds of our way to our destination. The
friars, however, having, as I afterwards learned,
agreed, in writing, to give the captain 250 Spanish
dollars if he would return, carried their point; and all
that remained to be done was to bear the disappointment
with patience.</p>

<p>In returning to Leghorn, it was necessary to put
into the first port we could reach for provisions; and,
accordingly, on the 19th of September, we cast anchor
at Zante. Here I made known our misfortune to
the government secretary, Colonel Maclean, who very
obligingly came down to the health-office to see me,
our vessel being in quarantine: and I had reason, from
what he told me, to be well satisfied with having
escaped as we did; for I learned from him that it was
quite a miracle that any respect had been paid to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
English name, since many piracies, accompanied with
violence and outrage, had been lately committed on
English vessels. At Zante I saw in the quarantine
ground hundreds of wretched Greeks, in rags and
misery, driven from their country, and not knowing
where to find a place to lay their heads.</p>

<p>On the 27th of September we weighed anchor, and,
when off Sicily, nearly lost our masts in a gale of
wind. The next day we were alarmed by the kitchen’s
catching fire, and by a passenger falling ill of fever;
after which, we ran on the island of Elba in a fog, and
finally arrived at Leghorn on the 12th of October,
1827.</p>

<p>The passenger I have named was an Italian, one
Signor Girolamo ——, a young man, who, after very
successful studies at Padua, thought to turn his talents
to account in Mahomet Ali’s service; but, on his
arrival in Egypt, he was nearly starved. He was a
clever mathematician, and of great literary attainments;
but he forgot that, to teach, one must be
enabled to explain, which, from his ignorance of Arabic,
was impossible, and that Mahomet Ali wanted officers,
mechanics, and engineers—practical men—but not
schoolmen. Having in vain essayed to find an employment,
he was at last told he might take service, if
he would pronounce himself competent for the situation
of hospital-mate and apothecary to an infantry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
regiment. In this his medical employment, according
to what he told me, he saw so much peculation going
forward, that, being ordered to Navarino, with his
regiment, in disgust, he made his escape to Zante,
determined to have done with Pashas and Eastern
civilization for ever. Anxiety, fatigue, and blasted
prospects, threw him into a malignant fever; and his
deplorable situation, in the empty hold of a vessel,
without bed or blanket to sleep on, could not but excite
our sympathy.</p>

<p>There was one of the friars, named Fra’ Buonaventura,
who, after the plunder of the vessel, when we
were on our passage back, was guilty of a breach of
confidence so base, that I hardly know how to designate
it. He was the one to whom the bag of letters from
Europe for the monks of the different monasteries in
the Holy Land had been entrusted. These letters,
being of no use to the Greeks, were left; and Fra’
Buonaventura used to lie on his back in his berth, and,
breaking the seals, read them one by one, and then
destroy them. His conduct appeared to me so culpable,
that I wrote to the Neapolitan ambassador (he
belonging to a monastery at Naples), and requested
his Excellency to make this violation of trust known
to his superiors.</p>

<p>We remained in quarantine until the 17th of November,
during which time the news of the battle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
Navarino reached Leghorn. From the Lazaretto I
took my family to Pisa and Rome; and, the bad
weather being now set in, I resolved to await the
return of spring, and the arrival of fresh letters from
Lady Hester Stanhope, before venturing again on so
dangerous a voyage. Besides, the shock had been
very great, and Mrs. ——’s health was seriously impaired
by continued sea-sickness and the horrors of
the scenes she had witnessed, which for many months
often recurred in her dreams, so as to bring on a nervous
affection, which did not entirely leave her for
two years.</p>

<p>What Lady Hester Stanhope’s situation was at
this particular date may be gathered from a letter
which she wrote to the late Mr. John Webb, her
banker, at Leghorn, and of which I annex a copy.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right r2">
Djoun, Mount Lebanon, May 30, 1827.
</p>

<p class="indent2">Sir,</p>

<p>A <i>Firmanlee</i>,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> having taken refuge in the mountain,
under the protection of the Emir Beshýr, contrived to
pick a quarrel with my water-carrier, who was quietly
going about his business, and, having bribed some of
the Emir’s Jack Ketches, they beat him most unmercifully.
The Emir Beshýr and his chief people have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
likewise been bribed by this man, who has plenty of
money at his disposal. They have all, therefore, taken
the <i>Firmanlee’s</i> part, and acted in the most atrocious
way towards me. A short time since, the Emir thought
proper to publish in the villages that all my servants
were instantly to return to their homes, upon pain of
losing their property and lives. I gave them all their
option. Most of them have remained firm, being aware
that this order is the most unjust, as well as the most
ridiculous, that ever was issued. Since that, he has
threatened to seize and murder them here, which he
shall not do without taking away my life too. Besides
this, he has given orders in all the villages that men,
women, and children, shall be cut in a thousand pieces,
who render me the smallest service. My servants, of
course, as you must imagine, cannot go out, and the
peasants of the village cannot approach the house.
Therefore, I am in no very pleasant situation, being
deprived of the necessary supplies of food, and, what is
worse, of water; for all the water here is brought upon
mules’ backs up a great steep.</p>

<p>I should not be a thorough-bred Pitt, if fear were
known to me, or if I could bow to a monster who could
chain together the neck and feet of a venerable, white-bearded,
respectable man, who has burnt out eyes, cut
out tongues, chopped off the breasts of women by shutting
down heavy box-lids upon them, put them upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
red-hot irons, hung them up by their hair, mutilated
men alive, and, if a father has escaped from his clutches,
has loaded his infant son with his chains! For the
space of three years, I have refused to have the smallest
communication with the Emir. He sent me one of
his grand envoys the other day—one of those who are
charged with the budget of lies sent to Mahomet Ali.
I refused to see him, or to read the letter of which he
was the bearer.</p>

<p>My kind friend and former physician, Dr. ——,
having heard that for some years my situation has not
been a pleasant one, and that my health is very indifferent,
has given a proof of attachment and disinterestedness
very rare in these times. He has blasted his
own prospects in life by giving up every thing in Europe
to join me in this country, without consulting any one.
He wrote to me from France that, if he did not hear
from me by the 25th of April, he should proceed to
Leghorn, and there embark for this country. The
state of my sight has prevented me from keeping up a
correspondence with him as formerly; but, if letters
I wrote to him in the beginning of the year have been
forwarded to him from England, perhaps he may have
changed his determination. But, in the case of his
being at Leghorn, you would confer a great obligation
upon me, if you would advance him £100 for his expenses,
and deliver him the enclosed letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
I must particularly request that neither you nor any
of your people will communicate anything respecting
my affairs to Mr. ——, for he publishes everything
in the most disadvantageous way to every blackguard
in the town of Beyrout.</p>

<p>I hope you will have received the wine I sent you
safe. It is needless to tell you I cannot at this moment
execute your commission, but I hope to do it to your
satisfaction at some future period.</p>

<p>Ten thousand thanks for your kind recipe for my
eyes. I have not had a moment’s time to bestow a
thought upon myself since I received it.</p>

<p>Dear Lord Frederick!<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> what changes have taken
place in my situation since I saw him last! but I am
too much of a Turk to complain of the decrees of
Heaven.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention that there is a plague at Sayda.
Most of the people are shut up; and, although I must
have suffered cruelly from the malady formerly, I am
in no apprehension concerning it, as I am a perfect
predestinarian. Happy for me that I have inspired
the same feelings into all those who surround me.</p>

<p>If it please God that I, like Joseph, should come
safe out of the well, I hope it will be needless to assure
you that, whatever part of your family might fall in
my way, my greatest pleasure would be to endeavour
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
to make them, by every service and attention, the evidence
of the respect and regard which I bear you.</p>

<p class="right r2">
<span class="smcap">H. L. Stanhope.</span>
</p>

<p>PS. Long before you can receive this letter, this
business must be settled. Depend upon it, I shall be
a match for them. I shall trouble you to give Dr. ——
the information contained in this letter, begging him
to guard complete silence on everything that relates
to this country or elsewhere; for things are in an
unpleasant state both here and at Cyprus.</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Some time in the spring, but the exact day is not
noted, I received the following letter from Lady Hester
<span class="lock">Stanhope:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right r2">
Djoun, Nov. 9, 1827.
</p>

<p>I have not heard from or written to you for eight
months. My three letters, composing one, must have
reached you. I have not made my intended journey,
for I have been, during three months of this summer,
absolutely as if in prison. The representatives of the
John Bulls in this country having impressed the
Emir Beshýr with the assurance that I had not a
friend in the world, he proceeded upon unheard-of
outrages towards me; and, if he did not actually
put my life in danger, he had it publicly cried,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
that whoever served me should be bastinadoed and
amerced.</p>

<p>This unheard-of stretch of insolence was set to rights
by our old acquaintance<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> at Constantinople, who acted
very well towards me. The Emir Beshýr, with all
the art and meanness well known to him, has now
become abjectly humble. One of his people told me
that it was not his doings, but the work of ——, who
had put it into his head; and, finding he had made
a false calculation, and displeased great and small in
the country by his vile conduct, he is humble enough,
and repents having given me an opportunity of showing
what I am. I am thus become more popular than ever,
having shown an example of firmness and courage no
one could calculate upon:—it was poor little David
and the giant. But the God who defended David
defended me from all the assassins by whom I was
surrounded. Even water from the spring the beast
would not let me have. The expense to get provisions
brought in the night by people was enormous. Some
risked their lives to serve me, and bring me food.
One person only came openly, and that was a woman,
saying she would die sooner than obey such atrocious
orders, and called down curses on the Emir, the consuls,
and all of them. This conduct was well worthy
a follower of Ali.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
The plague this year has carried off thousands of
inhabitants at Damascus and Aleppo; it is now in
the Mountain. There are all sorts of fevers, too,
besides plague, and my medicine is nearly all gone;
for all the world come to me for what they want. I
have written to Mr. Allen, to beg he will give me a
year’s credit for a little common medicine, and he sends
you this letter. If there is war, how am I to get it?
but I will run the chance.</p>

<p>A young <i>seyd</i>, a friend of mine, when riding one day
in a solitary part of the mountain, heard the echo of
a strange noise in the rocks. He listened, and, hearing
it again, got off his horse to see what it was. To
his surprise, in a hollow in the rock, he saw an old
eagle, quite blind and unfledged by age. Perched by
the eagle, he saw a carrion-crow feeding him. If the
Almighty thus provides for the blind eagle, he will
not forsake me: and the carrion-crow may look down
with contempt on your countrymen.</p>

<p>I say this, because I have seen two doctors—they
were English—and they tell me that, though my eyes
are good, my nerves are destroyed, and that causes
my blindness. Writing these few lines will be some
days’ illness to me: but I make an effort, in order
to assure you of the grief I have felt at being, I fear,
the cause of your affairs being worse than if you had
not known me. All I can say is, if God helps me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
I shall not forget you. You can do nothing for me
now; trust in God and think of the eagle. Remember!
all is written: we can change nothing of our fate
by lamenting and grumbling. Therefore, it is better
to be like a true Turk, and do our duty to the last,
and then beg of the believers in one God a bit of daily
bread, and, if it comes not, die of want, which perhaps
is as good a death as any other, and less painful. But
never act contrary to the dictates of conscience, of
honour, of nature, or of humanity.</p>

<p>What I shall do, or not do, is the business of no
one; so on that head I shall say nothing. God is the
disposer of all events. Do not write to me. First, I
shall not get your letters; and, besides, I do not wish
to hear a thousand lies: for you dare not write otherwise,
I know, unless left to yourself. Leave everything
to a great and all-powerful Being, who will empower
me to act under all circumstances. I have had,
as things are, reason to bless His mercy every day.
No one else could get out of such difficulties of every
kind unprotected by an Almighty’s hand. I have
written these few lines with the hope of comforting
you a little, and to let you see I have a soul, though
my body is wasted to nothing, with anxiety, want of
food, rest, &amp;c. Don’t expect any more letters. If
you wish to do me harm, you will talk of me and my
affairs to fools, and strangers, and curious people: but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
it is now come to such a pass, that it little signifies
what any one does or says. God bless you!</p>

<p class="right r2">

</p>

<p>If Dr. Madden should call on Dr. Scott,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> to talk
Arabic and philosophy, it is I who sent him. Strange
opinions are not for ignorant, vulgar people. Perhaps
you may see Dr. Madden. Of private affairs, I only
said to him that I was in debt.</p>

[Supposed date] October, 1827.
</p>

<p>I thank you a thousand times, my dear sir, for the
anxiety you express on my account; and, although
surrounded by a hundred difficulties, I am cheerful,
and, as I said before, the Turks behave very well to
me. That old monster, the Emir Beshýr, is pretty
quiet at this moment, at least as far as regards me:
but he is reducing to beggary and to misery all who
surround him. A real Turk is a manly, though
rather violent, kind-hearted being, and, if he has
confidence in you, very easy to deal with. I have
often wondered at their gentlemanlike patience with
low, blustering, vulgar men, who give themselves
more airs than an ambassador, because chance has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
placed them as consul or agent in some dirty town
not equal to a village in France; men who, in fact,
in Europe, would scarcely have their bow returned in
the street by a man of condition. It is the general
conduct of these sort of people that has given the
Orientals such a false idea of Europeans. The race
of Christians here is of the vilest people in the world:
not all totally without talent, but all born without
principle, or one single good quality. Out of the great
number of children, both boys and girls, which I have
taken before they have changed their teeth, not one
has turned out passable, and most of them have
become vagabonds. If a poor man falls ill, and gives
his wife a little trouble to wait upon him, she soon
ends the business with a little poison; and, if a woman
marries again, the husband casts off all her children
by the former marriage, and she, without remorse,
leaves them to die in a hovel, or abandons them under
a tree to beg for subsistence. It was only last night
that one of these wretched beings came to me, skin
and bone, having been for thirty days ill of a fever.
The very girls I have brought up with the greatest
care have, when married, beaten their children of two
years old so violently as to stun them; and one, from
the blow she gave her child upon the back, caused the
bowels to protrude more than a span. A man thinks
nothing of taking up a stone as large as his head, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
throwing it at his wife when she is with child. These
are the beastly people that create the compassion of
Europeans—a horrid race, that deserves to be exterminated
from the face of the earth. What a contrast
between these wretches and the wild Arabs, who will
traverse burning sands barefooted, to receive the last
breath of some kind relation or friend, who teach their
children at the earliest period resignation and fortitude,
and who always keep alive a spirit of emulation
amongst them! They are the boldest people in the
world, yet are endued with a tenderness quite poetic,
and their kindness extends to all the brute creation by
which they are surrounded. For myself, I have the
greatest affection and confidence in these people: besides,
I admire their diamond eyes, their fine teeth,
and the grace and agility (without capers), which is
peculiar to them alone. When one sees these people,
one’s thoughts naturally revert to the time of Abraham,
when man had not his head filled with all the
false systems of the present day.</p>

<p>I must now thank you for a most admirable cheese,
and the case of <i lang="fr">liqueurs</i> which accompanied it. You
tell me not to send any more wine; but I shall
not attend to it. I only regret that I cannot forward
more by this conveyance; for it is excessively scarce,
which will account for the small quantity; but I shall
always continue to ship some, whenever I can procure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
it; and I only wish this country produced anything
that would be agreeable to you or Mrs. Webb.</p>

<p>I have heard that at Geneva there are very fine
flowers. If you will procure me a few seeds, I
should be very much obliged to you, as my stock of
flowers this year has become very low, owing to my
having had a very careless gardener, who neglected to
water the seeds, so that they never came up. My
fine steed is gone long ago, and my garden remains
my only amusement. I have made a little note;
but, if there should be any other showy flowers or
shrubs, pray include them. Very small flowers are
considered here as weeds, however pretty they may be.</p>

<p>I have received my account from your house, and
I have drawn for another thousand dollars. They
tell me, besides, that the doctor is gone to England.
If so, I fear some trick will be played me, and he will
not be allowed to return. It does not signify—I am
an Arab.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> I have, however, written to him, desiring
him, in case of his return, to beg you to attend most
particularly to the state of your health and that of
Mrs. Webb, and that he will leave with you a volume
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
of medical advice. The other letter you will please
to forward to his friend, Mr. N. S.</p>

<p>It was immediately after the date of this letter
that the news of the battle of Navarino must have
reached Sayda and Beyrout. On that occasion, all
the Franks at Sayda, in a single hour, fled precipitately
from their homes, the greater part of them
taking refuge with Lady Hester Stanhope. In the
narrative of her subsequent conversations, some account
of the expense she was put to by this unforeseen
event will be found; for, in her correspondence
with me, she was particularly careful not to make any
allusion to the universal alarm which prevailed amongst
the Europeans, lest it might possibly have some influence
upon the fears of my family, and deter us
from prosecuting our journey.</p>

<p>Some private business requiring my presence in
England, I left Italy in June, 1828, for London, and
returned to Pisa in the following October. Up to
this time (now nearly a year), I had had no answer
from Lady Hester to my letters (one from Zante,
and one from Leghorn), in which I had given an
account of the piracy. At that time there were no
steamboats on those waters, and correspondence was
necessarily carried on, at great risk and uncertainty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
by merchant-vessels, many of which were plundered
by the Greeks, while others frequently consumed two
or three months, returning from the Levant to Marseilles
or Leghorn. At last, a letter reached me, in
the handwriting of Miss Williams, dictated by Lady
Hester Stanhope.</p>

Djoun, Mount Lebanon, March 23, 1828.
</p>

<p>I have received the account of your disasters by
sea, and latterly the books you were so good as to
send me. The books I cannot read, and I have
nobody to read them to me: however, I thank you
for your kind attention. I am much afflicted at the
trouble and vexation you have had, and at the situation
in which you find yourself. I must say, it would
be very imprudent to bring women or children into
this country at this moment, and a great source of
fatigue and vexation to me; for they could not be
comfortable under the present circumstances of the
times. What I should propose is, that, when you
have settled your business, you immediately set off
alone with a Dutch passport,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> in case things should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
turn out ill before you arrive. Leave Mrs. —— at Pisa,
where she could remain very comfortably until you
return. Write to X. these few words—“She has ordered
me to forbid you evermore to interfere with her
affairs, or even to write to her.”</p>

<p>The plague will be over before you get here. The
Turks behave extremely well to me, the Christians
and Franks as ill. I shall say nothing about the
state of my affairs—(you may guess what it may be
in these times) nor of the state of my health, without
a person of any kind to assist me in anything. If I
outlive the storm, I may help you:—if not, you can
take poor Williams away.</p>

<p>Let Mr. Webb know how much I prize his kind
attentions. I hope some wine will go with this ship
for him:—if not, it is not my fault. Salute Mrs. ——
and say I hope no childish feeling will prevent her
allowing you to be absent a little while. I feel for
her—but I cannot write. She may rely upon me:
only obey me strictly. Had you done so before,
things might have been otherwise for all: but simpletons
will be wise men, and that is what has turned the
world upside down, as well as caused much unhappiness
to individuals. I promise to keep you only a
few months, but I want to see you: only come in as
silent and quiet a way as you can.</p>

<p>I will not receive any letter from X., so do not take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
charge of any: all must be lies. Return them, should
he send any, and say not a word that you mean to
come here.</p>

</p>

<p>I have heard from Mr. Webb’s house that you are
gone to England. My heart misgives me: I fear
some trick, and that they will prevent your coming.
At all events, do not let your head be crammed with
ideas that you cannot land; for, notwithstanding the
departure of consuls and Franks from this part of the
world, I firmly believe that, any one coming to me
either in a man-of-war or in an open boat, his landing
would not be opposed, even if things were more decidedly
bad than they are at present. Sulyman Effendi,
whom you recollect at Sayda, is governor of Beyrout,
and Ali Aga has succeeded him at Sayda; Laurella,
as Austrian consul, still remains at Beyrout, though
but little friendly to me, as does old Gerardin at Sayda;
being considered as an Arab. Never write to me but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
through Mr. Webb’s house, whether you come or do
not come. I want no reasons and no long stories. I
hope your head will not be turned, because I am sure
you will repent it hereafter, if it is.</p>

<p>Arabize yourself before you get here, if you are ever
such a quiz. I have common Turkish clothes ready
for you, that you may not cut up and gobble good
cloth in a hurry.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> You must not think of bringing
any Frank servant with you. I have a room ready
for you, and I hope you will be very comfortable.
The difficulty about Mrs. —— was want of room; and
a house in the village in these sort of times is not exactly
the thing, though I had a pretty little house,
two stories high, picked out for you, had you come
sooner. Cut short impertinent questions <em>here</em>, by
saying everybody was out of town, that you saw
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
none of my family or friends, and only stopped a few
days in London to transact your own private business.</p>

<p>In compliance with Lady Hester Stanhope’s wishes,
I resolved to await the coming of spring, in order to
conduct my family to England, and, leaving them
there, to set off alone for Syria. But new difficulties
had arisen, and Lady Hester’s situation had become
more painful by a severe loss which she unexpectedly
sustained in the death of her long-tried and affectionate
companion, Miss Williams. It was some time in
December that Mr. Webb, of Leghorn, communicated
to me a letter from Lady Hester Stanhope, giving him
the melancholy news of this sad event. The letter
was in French, dictated to some secretary whom she
had found to carry on her correspondence, and it is
here translated for the convenience of the general
reader.</p>

<p class="p2 center">
<cite>Lady Hester Stanhope to Mr. John Webb, merchant,<br>
at Leghorn.</cite>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right r2">
Djoun, 24th of October, 1828.
</p>

<p class="indent2">Sir,</p>

<p>When I received your letter of the 17th of July, I
was very ill, confined to my room, and occasionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
delirious: nevertheless, in a moment of reason, I
desired Mr. Gerardin to acquaint you with the great
loss I had sustained in the faithful Miss Williams.</p>

<p>After two years of plague, there broke out, over
almost all Mount Lebanon, a kind of fever, which I do
not know precisely how to name. Whether it was a
sort of yellow or malignant fever, poor Miss Williams
fell a victim to it, as well as a servant, named Môosa,
the only one in whom I had any confidence; and I but
just escaped death from it myself. I am, as it were,
come to life again by a miracle, owing to the attentions
of a rich peasant, who came from a considerable distance
to assist me. He found me entirely abandoned,
delirious, and at the point of death; and left in that
state by whom?—by wicked maids, who had cost Miss
W. and me such pains in endeavouring to make something
of them. You may easily imagine that I did
not keep such ungrateful sluts an instant after I came
to myself. Even in the weak state in which I was, I
felt in a rage at the deplorable accounts which were
given me of the detestable indifference which they
showed when Miss W. was dying, occupying themselves
in pilfering what they could lay their hands on:
but I have already told you what the Christians of
this country are. At the present moment, I have
nobody to assist me but some old women of the village,
the most stupid and ignorant creatures in the world.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
My greatest resource is a girl of eight years old,
whom I have brought up, who appears attached to me,
and who is less stupid than the others.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> However,
one cannot get well very fast, attended by such people,
to whom it is impossible to trust a key. I am moved
from my bed to the sofa, and from the sofa to the bed,
and I am not yet able to walk unsupported; but, if I
was better waited on, and had more quiet and proper
things to eat, I know very well what an effort my iron
constitution would make, which has brought me through
this illness without doctor or doctor’s-stuff. I have a
good appetite; but my weakness of stomach does not
enable me to digest the coarse and badly-cooked food
which they give me to eat, seeing that my stomach
has been very much disordered for want of nourishment
during fifteen days, having subsisted all that time on
barley-water and plain water.</p>

<p>My ignorance of what passed around me was not,
properly speaking, the delirium of fever; it was a
stupor, caused by the neglect with which I was
treated. The peasant says that, when he entered
my bed-room,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> he found me stiff and cold, in the state
of one dying of hunger: he gave me food immediately.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
After some days I came to myself, and am
now gaining strength. But, in the midst of all this,
I am not melancholy. What has happened has
happened, and whatever is is best. To-day I was
telling Mr. Beaudin<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> some anecdotes of the celebrated
Duke of Dorset, which were of no very mournful
turn. Mr. Beaudin’s coming has been of the greatest
service to me in every way. He has raised for me,
with a great deal of difficulty, some money, for which
I have given him my bill of exchange for 1000
dollars, dated October the 15th. I have given him
another bill for 500 dollars, dated the 24th of October.
I endeavour to scrape together as much as I can,
because the aspect of the times is dark. I must lay
in provisions of all kinds; for in a short time it will
not be so easy to do it, as some imagine, and prices
will rise to something incredible.</p>

<p>It seems to me that, if Dr. —— had decided on
coming, he would have been here before now. Well!
I have got over this illness without his assistance, or
that of any other doctor, and one feels much more
elevated when God has been one’s physician. It is
the Supreme Being alone who has saved me in all my
difficulties for these last twenty years, and who has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
given me strength to support what others would have
sunk under.</p>

<p>With the bills, drawn through Mr. Bell and
Mr. Beaudin, there are life-certificates. You know
my weakness of sight, and that, consequently, I
cannot write the bills myself; but, thank God! I
can still, though with great pain, read a letter,
although I cannot extend the effort to books and
newspapers. This is the reason why I have had the
bills of exchange, to the order of Mr. Beaudin,
written by old General Loustaunau, and those, to
Mr. Bell, written by Mr. Beaudin; nor must you
wonder, if, another time, Mr. Beaudin should himself
write bills to his own order.</p>

<p>The mercantile house of ——, at ——, has asked
me for a letter of introduction to you, because they
say you are a man of high respectability: but I
should be very sorry to render a service to such
rogues.</p>

<p>The distressed situation in which Lady Hester
Stanhope found herself by such a severe calamity as
the loss of Miss Williams, who, in sickness and in
health, had been all in all to her, induced me to set
aside every other consideration, and to resolve on
making the voyage to Syria without loss of time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
even in the depth of winter, although the navigation
of the Mediterranean is exceedingly boisterous in the
months of January, February, and March. I accordingly
went over to Leghorn, and entered into an
agreement with the master of a merchant-vessel, who
was to sail in a few days for Beyrout. Nothing
remained but to sign it; but, previously to so doing,
I had to overcome the repugnance which Mrs. ——
felt to being left behind, if she remained, and the
apprehension of fresh piracies, if she accompanied me.
Between the two she hesitated and wavered until the
opportunity was lost, and, being unable to make up
her mind one way or the other, spring came, and then
summer, until it was finally settled that I should take
her back to England, and, leaving her there, return
and perform the voyage alone.</p>

<p>We accordingly set off for Marseilles in August,
1829, and traversed France as far as Paris. But
there her womanish fears, and the dread of losing me
in a foreign country by plague, and a thousand ills,
which persons, who have not visited the East, fancy
to be more common in distant countries than at home,
still preyed on her mind, and a fresh resolution was
formed to accompany me. We therefore returned to
Marseilles: but not until November, 1830, could I
prevail upon her to set her foot in a vessel.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of November, we set sail from Marseilles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
in the Belle Sophie, Coulonne master, a brig
of 220 tons or thereabouts. We had secured the
state-room, and one berth out of four which the cabin
contained. Two others were occupied by two English
ladies, and the fourth by the captain. Temporary
berths were fitted up for three Englishmen adjoining
the companion-ladder, who, in society with these
pious ladies, had embarked on the wide world in the
holy mission of making proselytes among Jews and
Mahometans.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> On the floor and lockers of the cabin
was an Arab woman with three daughters and a son,
whilst her husband, with a Cypriot Greek, were
tenants of the hold. Thus we were twelve cabin-passengers,
where six only could have been comfortably
accommodated: but no scruples of this kind would
appear to have ever crossed the conscience of the
master of the vessel or the owners.</p>

<p class="p2">We reached Beyrout, after a prosperous voyage, on
the 8th of December, having anchored eight days at
Cyprus to disembark some merchandize, the Arab
family, and the English party. In pursuance of Lady
Hester Stanhope’s injunctions, I dressed myself in an
old faded suit of Turkish clothes, and thus presented
myself at the English and French consuls’ residences.
My appearance certainly was not calculated to make
her ladyship’s creditors suppose I came loaded with
money to pay her debts; and I felt, as I passed
through the streets, that my old Bedouin manteau
or <dfn>abah</dfn>, and indeed my whole dress, in which I
had twice traversed the desert to Palmyra, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
of a hue and age to dissipate the hopes of the most
sanguine.</p>

<p>I lost no time in sending off a messenger to announce
my arrival to Lady Hester Stanhope; and
received a note from her on the 11th, in which, after
congratulating us on our safety, she expressed the
pleasure it would give her to see me; she added that,
as for my family, they must not expect any other
attentions from her than such as would make them
comfortable in their cottage; that they were not to
take this ill on her part, as she had long before apprized
me that she did not think English ladies could
make themselves happy in Syria, and that therefore
I, who had brought them, must take the consequences.
This reception was not very agreeable to my feelings,
but it was highly characteristic of Lady Hester.</p>

<p>With the bearer of the letter her ladyship sent
camels for our luggage, donkeys for my family, and a
horse for me. At <i>Nebby Yôoness</i>, where we slept the
first night, we found another of her servants, who
had been sent thither to prepare our dinner and beds;
and, on the following day, two miles from her house,
we met Mr. Jasper Chasseaud, her secretary, who
had come thus far to welcome us. Placing my family
under this gentleman’s guidance, I hurried forward
alone, and reached Lady Hester Stanhope’s residence
about noon. A cottage had been provided for us in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
the village of Jôon, with two black slaves for servants,
and, so far as the accommodation was concerned, we
had no reason to be discontented. Mr. Chasseaud
accompanied my family to their new home, but it was
twelve at night before I was able to join them.</p>

<p>I found Lady Hester in good health and excellent
spirits, and looking much the same as when I left her
some years before. She received me with great apparent
pleasure, kissing me on each cheek, ordering
sherbet, the pipe, coffee, and a finjàn<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> of orange-flower
water; all which civilities, at meeting, are regarded
in the East as marks of the most cordial and
distinguished regard. I myself was truly astonished
at all this, but more especially at her salutation on
the cheeks after the Oriental fashion; for, in the
early part of her travels, when I was with her for
seven years together, I do not recollect that she had
often even taken my arm—an honour she seldom
vouchsafed to any body less than a member of the
aristocracy. My astonishment was increased, when,
for several days in succession, she insisted on my
always sitting by her on the sofa—a privilege she
rarely, indeed, I believe never, allowed to any one
afterwards.</p>

<p>The conversation turned at first on such inquiries
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
as are common, after a long separation, to persons
who have known each other before. I remained with
her from noon until midnight, in vain endeavouring
to get away, during which time I hardly moved from
the sofa, except to sit down to dinner. A description
of the dinner appointments of this lady, who once
presided at Mr. Pitt’s table in the splendour of wealth
and fashion, may be considered both curious and interesting.
She sat on the sofa, and I opposite to her,
on a common rush-bottom chair, with an unpainted
deal table (about three feet by two and a half between
us), covered with a scanty tablecloth, of the kind
usually spread on a bed-room table at an inn. Two
white plates, one over the other, French fashion, were
placed before each of us, and in the centre of the
table were three dishes of yellow earthenware (common
in the south of France), containing a pilàf, a <dfn>yackney</dfn>,
or sort of Irish stew, and a boiled fowl, swimming in
its broth. There were two silver table-spoons for
each of us, which, she said, were all she had, and two
black bone-handled knives and forks. One spoon was
for the broth, one for the <dfn>yackney</dfn>; and, when the
pilàf was to be served, we helped ourselves with the
same spoons with which we had been eating. The
arrangements were completed by a black bottle with
Mount Lebanon wine in it, of exquisite flavour, it is
true, and a common water-decanter. She said that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
this style the young Duke of Richelieu had dined with
her; adding, however, that her destitute state as to
dishes and table-service was not quite so deplorable
previously to the long illness she had gone through;
but that, at that melancholy period, her slaves and
servants had robbed her of everything, even to the
cushions and covers of her sofa.</p>

<p>At length, after frequently pleading the anxiety my
family must feel at being left so many hours in a
strange habitation, I contrived to make my escape,
and found Mrs. ——, on my return, sitting disconsolate
in the midst of her trunks, under a conviction
that I must either have been lost, or devoured by the
wolves and hyænas, with whose neighbouring depredations,
for want of other subjects of conversation,
the secretary had endeavoured to entertain her.
There was no great difficulty in appeasing her fears on
such occasions, of which we had afterwards so many
repetitions; but it was not quite so easy to reconcile
her to the undisguised slights which Lady Hester
Stanhope put upon her from the very moment of our
arrival, in retaliation, as we supposed, for the repeated
delays, of which Lady Hester believed her to
have been the cause, in the prosecution of my journey.
Her ladyship’s resentment was probably rendered
still more severe by her general want of sympathy
towards her own sex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
The reader will pardon these extraneous details.
They are introduced for the sake of preserving entire
the thread of the narrative, and certainly with no
acrimonious feeling towards Lady Hester Stanhope,
whose motive, as she afterwards told me, for adopting
this strange line of conduct towards my family, was
to check in the bud the womanish caprices, which she
anticipated might otherwise disturb the harmony of
our intercourse.</p>

<p>Before we commence our diary, it is necessary to
give a description of the residence which Lady Hester
Stanhope had chosen, in order to avoid the confusion
which an ignorance of localities is sometimes calculated
to produce.</p>

<p>Her first retreat, when she settled in Syria in 1813,
was an old monastic house, about two miles from the
ancient city of Sidon: but this she found much too
small for her establishment; and having observed, in
one of her rides whilst living there, a small house near
the village of Jôon,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> or Djoun, as the French spell it
to accommodate the sound to their pronunciation, she
resolved to hire it, and remove thither. It belonged
to one Joseph Seweyah, a Damascus merchant, who
very readily let it to her for 1,000 piasters, or £20
a-year, as the exchange was then, on condition that,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
on quitting it, the buildings and improvements she
might make were to revert to him and his heirs,
without any consideration on his part. The house
was, and is, called Dar Jôon (see the view), <dfn>dar</dfn> signifying
a Hall, or gentleman’s dwelling, as when we say
Boxwood Hall, Wortley Hall. <dfn>Dar</dfn> also means a
<dfn>mount</dfn>, or elevated hunch. In which of the two senses
the word is applied in Dar Jôon I could not learn,
as some Arabs told me one way, and some the other.</p>

<p>The mount on which the house stands is shaped
like a half orange, with a flat on the summit, which
afforded room for exercising ground, a garden, stabling,
and any other additional buildings that might be
thought necessary. The garden, entirely of her own
creation, was richly diversified with covered alleys,
serpentine walks, summer-houses, pavilions, arbours,
and other embellishments, in which she displayed such
admirable taste, that it would not be easy, even in
England, to find a more beautiful garden within
similar limits.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Around the house Lady Hester built small rooms,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
stables, cottages, offices, and entire dwellings. The
rooms and dwellings were intended for lodging those
who, she expected, would fly to her for refuge, during
the revolutions which she believed were then impending,
not only over the country in which she resided,
but the whole world; and, anticipating that many
individuals, whose lives would be eagerly sought after
by their persecutors, might ask for an asylum at
her hands, she contrived several detached rooms, in
such a way, that persons dwelling within the precincts
of the same residence should be ignorant who their
neighbours were; whose vicinity, in like manner,
should be unknown to others. The whole was surrounded
by a wall more than ten feet high to the
north and east, and about six or seven feet high on
the other two sides. The entire space within the wall
was a <a id="chg2"></a>parallelogram.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>The buildings were, in some instances, composed of
a number of walls, one within the other like the
palace of the kings of the Medes (see the annexed
ground-plan); and owing to the different enclosures
wherein servants with different occupations lived, a
person attempting to enter, or to escape, was certain
of being seen, and almost equally certain of being
stopped. Two gateways opened into the buildings,
one for the men servants and visitors, and the other
for the women, and those who were introduced secretly
to her ladyship’s apartment. On entering by
either of these two gates, a stranger would be seriously
perplexed, and his first question would be,
Where am I going? Is this a labyrinth, with a door
here, and a dark passage there; a garden on one side,
a screen on the other; here a courtyard, there another?
what does it all mean? Some passages afforded
an immediate communication with parts which, to one
unacquainted with the building, and judging by the
roundabout approach from one to another, would
seem to be at least fifty or one hundred yards apart.
In the garden were two pavilions, with trap-doors in
the floor leading to steps which descended to a room
under ground, from which opened doors through the
wall upon the open country. More than one individual
has been indebted for his safety, if not for his
life, to these secret means of escape and shelter.</p>

<p>Her constant outlay in building arose not from the
love of brick and mortar witnessed in many persons
as they advance in years, but from the one predominant
idea, that to her the distressed, the proscribed,
the rich, the poor, would fly for protection, succour,
and concealment. And however erroneous the fancy
might have appeared at first (for events in some sort
proved she was right), nobody who really knew her
character could have suspected for a moment the
generosity and pure disinterestedness of her motives.
Her asses, mules, camels, and horses, were kept principally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
with the same view; and her servants were
taught to look forward, with a sort of awe and
religious expectation, to events and catastrophes,
where their services and energies would be tasked to
the utmost.</p>

<p>Besides the additions which Lady Hester Stanhope
was constantly making to her own residence, she had
hired four or five cottages in the village of Jôon, and
had bought an old ruined house there. This, she
said, she should repair, and convert into a sort of inn,
where she might conveniently lodge a number of those
persons who would be passing backward and forward
on the important affairs in which she was soon to
play so conspicuous a part. “And do not think,”
she one day observed, “when the time comes, that I
shall let your family, or that of my secretary, reside
in the houses you now occupy: these I shall want;
and I have in my eye, in a village about three leagues
off, an asylum for all the women and children, and
useless members of my establishment. There I shall
send them; and you will have to give up all the spare
room you can to the people who will take refuge
with me.”</p>

<p>It often formed a source of strange reflection with
me, what could have made Lady Hester Stanhope
select such a locality, so remote and solitary, instead
of living in a city, where the conveniences of life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
were readily accessible; and I at last came to the
conclusion, in my own mind, that it proceeded from
her love of absolute power, which could not be so
thoroughly gratified in the midst of a numerous population
as in a lonely and retired residence. She
chose to dwell apart, and out of the immediate reach
of that influence and restraint, which neighbourhood
and society necessarily exert upon us. Arbitrary acts
may lose at a distance some of their odiousness, or
admit of being explained away. Servitude also
becomes more helpless in proportion as it is removed
from the means of escape or appeal. Mar Elias, at
Abra, where she had previously resided six or eight
years, was scarcely two miles distant from Sayda; so
that her servants, when they were tired of her service,
could abscond by night, and take refuge in the city;
and her slaves, rendered low-spirited by the monotony
of their existence, could at any time run away, and
secrete themselves in the houses of the Turks. By
removing to Jôon, she cut off their retreat; for a poor
slave could rarely muster courage enough to venture
by night across lonely mountains, when jackalls
and wolves were abroad; or, if he did, by the time
he reached Sayda, or Beyrout, or Dair-el-kamar, the
only three towns within reach, his resolves had cooled,
the consequences of the step he had taken presented
themselves forcibly to his mind, or there was time to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
soothe him by promises and presents; all which palliatives
Lady Hester Stanhope knew well how to
employ. The love of power made her imperious;
but, when her authority was once acknowledged, the
tender of submission was sure to secure her kindness.
Unobserved escape was well nigh impracticable by
day, in consequence of the situation of the house on
the summit of a conical hill, whence comers and goers
might be seen on every side; yet, notwithstanding
this, on one occasion all her free women decamped in
a body, and on another her slaves attempted to scale
the walls, and some actually effected their object and
ran away.</p>

<p>In addition to these artificial barriers, she was
known to have great influence with Abdallah Pasha,
to whom she had rendered many services, pecuniary
and personal; for to him, as well as to his harým, she
was constantly sending presents; and he, as a Turk,
fostered despotism rather than opposed it. The Emir
Beshýr, or Prince of the Druzes, her nearest neighbour,
she had so completely intimidated by the unparalleled
boldness of her tongue and pen that he felt
no inclination to commit himself by any act which
might be likely to draw either of them on him again.
In what direction, therefore, was a poor unprotected
slave or peasant to fly? Over others, who were free to
act as they liked, as her doctor, her secretary, or her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
dragoman, and towards whom she had more <i lang="fr">menagemens</i>
to preserve, there hung a spell of a different kind, by
which this modern Circe entangled people almost inextricably
in her nets. A series of benefits conferred on
them, an indescribable art in becoming the depositary
of their secrets, an unerring perception of their failings,
brought home in moments of confidence to their bosoms,
soon left them no alternative but that of securing her
protection by unqualified submission to her will.</p>

<p>As a proof of this we may take the case of an English
gentleman, of acknowledged abilities and of good
professional education, who, about the years 1827 or
1828, after having remained attached to Lady Hester
Stanhope as her medical attendant for a certain period,
felt an insurmountable anxiety to quit her service.
The village of Jôon furnished beasts of burden for
hire, and Lady Hester Stanhope’s own mules went
two or three times a week to Sayda for corn, provisions,
&amp;c. A horse was at the doctor’s call for his
own riding, and the means of conveyance for so short
a distance as two leagues were always therefore at
hand. What, then, under such circumstances, could
have induced him to set off on foot, without giving
notice of his intention to anybody, if it were not that
he was aware he could not get away in any other
manner? When his absence was discovered, and it
was known that he was gone to Sayda, a letter from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
Lady Hester Stanhope could not bring him back,
neither could all the exhortations of her man of business,
sent for that purpose, make him alter the determination
he had taken not to return under her roof.</p>

<p>Yet, that the doctor’s emotions at the step he had
twice hurriedly ventured upon produced a painful
mental conflict cannot be doubted; for, in the room
at Sayda where he was found, he sat with his head
between his hands for some hours, weeping and sobbing,
as one who considered that an injurious interpretation
might be put on his flight, or as if Lady
Hester’s conduct towards him had driven him to it,
when he knew in his own heart, as his own letter to
her proved, that she had been a benefactress to him
at moments when it was not easy to find a friend.</p>

<p>As for consular interposition, under any circumstances,
most of the consuls along the coast had found
what a dangerous enemy she was: therefore, few of
them, perhaps not one, would have risked a contention
with her on any grounds. To have appealed to them,
the legitimate protectors of Franks, would, therefore,
have been fruitless.</p>

<p>At the time of my arrival, Lady Hester Stanhope’s
establishment consisted of Mr. Chasseaud, her secretary
(a nephew of Mr. Abbot’s, then the English
consul at Beyrout), who, with his wife and two infant
children, occupied, like ourselves, a cottage in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
village—of Paolo Perini, a Roman, her <i lang="fr">maître d’hôtel</i>,
seven black slaves, (five women, a man and a boy)
and a Metoûaly girl, named Fatôom, the daughter of
a peasant woman in the village, who principally waited
on her. There were besides a Mahometan groom,
two stablemen, a porter, a cook, and a scullion, three
or four men as muleteers and water-carriers, and two,
whose chief employment was to carry messages,
letters, &amp;c., to distant places, and who had been in
Lady Hester Stanhope’s service ten or fifteen years.
In addition to all these, she gave employment to a
score of workmen, who were constantly occupied in
different constructions.</p>

<p>Independently of these, there were two persons who
might be considered as her men of business in matters
that particularly regarded the natives. One was what
would be called a small farmer in England, and the
other a tailor by trade: they both lived in the village,
were sent for when they were wanted, received no
regular salary, but were paid for their services from
time to time in money, presents of corn, raiment, &amp;c.,
as is the custom in the East. The tailor was a cringing
knave, fit for a great person’s parasite. He had somehow
found his way into Lady Hester’s establishment,
from having married the daughter of a Syrian woman,
named Mariam, or Mary, a creature of incomparable
suavity of manners and considerable beauty, who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
been housemaid during her ladyship’s stay at Latakia,
some years before. This woman had two daughters,
one of whom, on becoming the tailor’s wife at about
twelve years of age, interested Lady Hester Stanhope
so far as to make her extend her favours to the husband:
he was named Yûsef el Tûrk. The other was a man
of a different description: he was club-footed; and it
was usually one of Lady Hester’s physiognomical
remarks that all club-footed people had something of
the Talleyrand in them—something clever in their
composition: he was called Girius Gemmal. On this
man’s character she would often dilate with much
commendation; but she always finished by calling
him a designing knave and a rogue. “He serves me
well,” she would say. “At whatever hour of the
night I ring my bell, he is always on his legs. If I
want to be talked to sleep, he has a number of amusing
stories to tell. He moves about so gently, that I
hardly hear him, although he is lame and hobbles on
one leg. There is sure to be hot water on the fire at
any hour, and he makes the girls look about them
somehow or other; but he is the greatest rascal that
ever walked the face of the earth.”</p>

<p>As to her health, she was better perhaps than
when I left her in 1820. Her pulse and her movements
indicated considerable vigour of body. Although
she had not stirred beyond the precincts of her residence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
as far as I could learn, for nearly four years,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
still she took the air and some exercise in her garden,
and in attending to and overlooking the building and
improvements that were constantly going on.</p>

<p>She was become more violent in her temper than
formerly, and treated her servants with severity when
they were negligent of their duty. Her maids and
female slaves she punished summarily, if refractory;
and, in conversation with her on the subject, she
boasted that there was nobody could give such a slap
in the face, when required, as she could.</p>

<p>Lady Hester Stanhope had adopted a particular
mode of dress, to which she adhered without much
variation, on all occasions, from the time she fixed her
abode at Jôon. It was a becoming one, and, at the
same time, concealed the thinness of her person, and
the lines which now began slightly to mark her face.
Lines, that mark the habitual contraction of the features
into a frown, a smile, or a grin, she had none;
and the workings of her mind were never visible in her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
lineaments, which wore the appearance of serene calm,
when she chose to disguise her feelings. But age will,
without furrowing the brow or the cheeks, bring on
that soil of network which we see on the rind of some
species of melons. This, however, was so very faintly
traced, that it could not be detected without a little
scrutiny: and, by means of a dim light in her saloon,
together with a particular management of her turban,
she contrived to conceal the inroads that years were
now making on what her bitterest enemies could not
deny was always a fine and noble face. It was this
kind of pardonable deceit that made me exclaim, on
meeting her again, after a long separation of several
years, that I saw no alteration in her appearance.</p>

<p>Her turban, a coarse, woollen, cream-coloured Barbary
shawl, was wound loosely round, over the red <i>fez</i>
or <dfn>tarbôosh</dfn>, which covered her shaved head; a silk
handkerchief, commonly worn by the Bedouin Arabs,
known by the Arabic name of <dfn>keffeyah</dfn>, striped pale
yellow and red, came between the fez and the turban,
being tied under the chin, or let fall at its ends on each
side of her face. A long sort of white merino cloak
(<dfn>meshlah</dfn>, or abah in Arabic, <span lang="ar">ابه</span>) covered her person
from the neck to the ancles, looped in white silk
brandenburgs over the chest; and, by its ample and
majestic drapery and loose folds, gave to her figure
the appearance of that fulness which it once really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
possessed. When her cloak happened accidentally to
be thrown open in front, it disclosed beneath a crimson
robe, (<dfn>joobey</dfn>) reaching also to her feet, and, if in
winter, a pelisse under it, and under that a cream-coloured
or flowered gown (<dfn>kombàz</dfn>), folding over in
front, and girded with a shawl or scarf round the
waist. Beneath the whole she wore scarlet pantaloons
of cloth, with yellow low boots, called <dfn>mest</dfn>, having
pump soles, or, in other words, a yellow leather stocking,
which slipped into yellow slippers or papouches.
This completed her costume; and, although it was in
fact that of a Turkish gentleman, the most fastidious
prude could not have found anything in it unbecoming
a woman, excepting its association, as a matter of habit,
with the male sex.</p>

<p>She never wore pearls, precious stones, trinkets, or
ornaments, as some travellers have affirmed: indeed,
she had none in her possession, and never had had
any from the time of her shipwreck. Speaking of her
own dress, she would say, “I think I look something
like those sketches of Guercino’s, where you see
scratches and touches of the pen round the heads and
persons of his figures, so that you don’t know whether
it is hair or a turban, a sleeve or an arm, a mantle or
a veil, which he has given them.” And, when she was
seated on the sofa, in a dim corner of the room, the
similitude was very just.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
It was latterly her pride to be in rags, but accompanied
by an extraordinary degree of personal cleanliness.
“Could the Sultan see me now,” she would
say, “even in my tattered clothes, he would respect
me just as much as ever. After all, what is dress?
Look at my ragged doublet, it is not worth sixpence;
do you suppose that affects my value? I warrant you,
Mahmôod would not look at <em>that</em> if he saw me. When
I think of the tawdry things for which people sigh,
and the empty stuff which their ambition pursues, I
heartily despise them all. There is nothing in their
vain-glorious career worth the trouble of aspiring after.
My ambition is to please God. I should be what I
intrinsically am, on a dunghill. My name is greater
than ever it was. In India, I am as well known as in
London or Constantinople. Why, a Turk told one of
my people who was at Constantinople that there is not
a Turkish child twenty miles round that place who has
not heard of me.”</p>

<p>There might, nevertheless, be perceived, under all
this assumption and display of tattered raiments, a
feeling of profound indignation at the neglect she had
experienced from her former friends and acquaintances;
and, for the purpose of affording evidence
of the way in which she had been left, as she called
it, to rot, she carefully preserved a bag of her old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
ragged clothes, which she would not suffer to be given
away.</p>

<p>The frequent alarm she expresses in her letters of
approaching blindness seems to have been nothing
more than the defective vision incident to the decline
of life. Spectacles in silver-gilt or tortoiseshell rims,
which I sent her from time to time in parcels containing
other small commissions, without hinting that
they were intended for her, she affected to consider,
when she got them, as only useful for presents to old
people to whom she was charitable. I now found that
she had taken to wear them, but of that kind worn by
poor old women in England, without branches, such
in fact as are stuck on the nose, and vulgarly called
barnacles.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Her voice on such occasions became nasal
from the compression of the nostrils, and at first she
was very reluctant to betray her use of these glasses
before me; but, after a short time, her objections wore
away: yet she never could be persuaded to wear any
other kind of spectacles, invariably giving away all
gay and handsome ones that were sent to her.</p>

<p>The influence she had enjoyed in Syria, during the
first years of her residence there, had been merely that
sort of consideration which is accorded to a person of
high descent and connections, who had made a great
figure in England, and who had acquired a romantic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
celebrity by her travels: it was the homage paid to an
illustrious name. But when, by degrees, her extraordinary
talents came to be known, more especially her
political abilities, and when it was observed that Pashas
and great men really valued her opinion and feared her
censure, she obtained a positive weight in the affairs
of the country on her own account, independently of the
<i lang="fr">prestige</i> of birth and notoriety.</p>

<p>Speaking of this, she one day said, “What offers
have not been made me! which, had I chosen not to
be clean-handed, would have put pretty sums into my
pocket.” Among the rest, she mentioned one man,
who had offered her a vast sum, if she would lend her
name and protection in some extensive mercantile
speculation. The Sheykh Beshýr (the acknowledged
chief of the Druze nation, and the powerful rival of the
Emir Beshýr, the reigning prince) sent her, when he
was proscribed and in flight, at three different times,
<i lang="fr">carte blanche</i> to settle with Abdallah Pasha or the Porte
the amount of the sum which would save his life:
“but,” she said, “knowing the Sheykh was not
clean-handed, I could not undertake to buy him off;
yet the whole of his treasures would have been at my
disposal.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
In relating this story, Lady Hester Stanhope added,
“How odious has Abdallah Pasha rendered himself
by his extortions and confiscations, because none of
his people will speak the truth to him! When he
wants money, his secretaries tell him he has only to
sign an order for it, and then perhaps half a dozen
families are driven into exile, or half ruined. But I
speak plainly to him; and once, when I wrote to him
how he was making himself hated by a particular act
of oppression about money, he tore the <dfn>buyurdee</dfn><a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> in
pieces, which gave force to that act, and drove his
secretaries out of his presence for having flattered and
deceived him. Why, doctor, when he receives a
letter from me, if there are half a dozen others at the
same time, he will let them lie on his sofa whilst he
reads mine, and then will put that alone into his
pocket, and take it into his harým to read over again.”</p>

<p>But Lady Hester’s nearest neighbour among Pashas
and Princes, and the one who, consequently, was the
most frequently mixed up in her affairs, was the
Emir Beshýr, prince of the Druzes; and, as his name
will necessarily occur very often in this diary, it is
desirable to give a sketch of his career and character.
At a remote period, his ancestors had migrated from
the neighbourhood of Mecca to this part of Syria,
and their origin was acknowledged to be noble. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
the course of time, his family had attained to great consideration
in Mount Lebanon, and stamped him, who
sprung from it, as an Emir, or Prince.</p>

<p>The Emir Beshýr was now the reigning prince of
the Druzes, himself a Mahometan born, but, as it is
said, professing Christianity, whenever it answered his
wicked ends to do so. In the annals of no country,
according to Lady Hester Stanhope, can be found a
man who has practised more barbarities, considering
the small extent of his principality, than he has done.
Not content with emasculating, he cut out the tongues
and put out the eyes of five young princes, nephews
and relatives of his own, whose contingent prospects
to the succession gave him uneasiness. His atrocities
transcend belief. All those who were obnoxious to
him, high or low, were sure, in the course of his protracted
despotism, to be removed, either by secret
machinations or overt acts. On Mount Lebanon it
was common to hear whispers that some one had been
made away with, but nobody dared to give utterance
to their suspicions of the agency.</p>

<p>This man was Lady Hester’s determined enemy.
She was living within his principality—within his
reach—and yet she braved him! and the greatest
proofs of personal courage that she had occasion to
show, perhaps, during her life, were manifested in her
bold and open defiance of his power; which is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
more extraordinary in a woman, apparently neglected
by her country and friends, towards a prince, who has
been certainly one of the most perfidious as well as
bloodthirsty tyrants that ever governed a Turkish
province.</p>

<p>Lady Hester, as I said, was domiciled within his
territory, and many were the petty vexations with
which he harassed her, in the hope of finally driving
her away; for he considered her as a very dangerous
neighbour, seeing that she openly cultivated the friendship
of the Sheykh Beshýr, his rival, and made no
disguise of her bad opinion of him, the Emir. Finding,
however, that she was determined to remain at
Jôon, some of his emissaries were employed to insinuate
the peril to which she would inevitably expose
her life if she persisted in her hostility to so powerful
a prince. But Lady Hester Stanhope was not a
woman to be frightened; and, when she found a fit
opportunity, in the presence of some other persons, of
getting one of the Emir’s people before her, so as to
be sure that what she said must reach his ears and
could not well be softened down, she desired the
emissary to go and tell his master that “She knew
very well there was not a more profound and bloody
tyrant on the face of the earth; that she was aware
no one was safe from his poisons and daggers—but
that she held him in the most sovereign contempt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
and set him at defiance. Tell him,” she added, “that
he is a dog and a monster, and that, if he means to
try his strength with me, I am ready.”</p>

<p>On another occasion, one of the Emir Beshýr’s
people came on some message to her, but, before he
entered her room, laid by his pistols and his sabre,
which in Turkey these myrmidons always wear on
their persons. Lady Hester’s maid whispered to her
what the man was doing, when her ladyship, calling
him in, bade him gird on his arms again. “Don’t
think I am afraid of you or your master,” she said;
“you may tell him I don’t care a fig for his poisons—I
know not what fear is. It is for him, and those
who serve him, to tremble. And tell the Emir
Khalyl” (the Emir Beshýr’s son) “that if he
enters my doors, I’ll stab him—my people shall
not shoot him, but <em>I</em> will stab him—I, with my own
hand.”</p>

<p>Lady Hester, after relating this to me, thus proceeded:
“The beast, as I spoke to him, was so terrified,
doctor, that he trembled like an aspen leaf, and I could
have knocked him down with a feather. The man told
the Emir Beshýr my answer; for there was a tailor at
work in the next room, who saw and heard him, and
spoke of it afterwards. The Emir puffed such a puff
of smoke out of his pipe when my message was delivered—and
then got up and walked out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
“Why, what did Hamâady<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> say to the Emir, when
he was deliberating how he should get rid of me?—‘You
had better have nothing to do with her. Fair
or foul means, it is all alike to her. She has been so
flattered in her lifetime, that no praise can turn her
head. Money she thinks no more of than dirt; and
as for fear, she does not know what it is. As for me,
your Highness, I wash my hands of her.’</p>

<p>“Oh, doctor, if you were to feel the bump behind my
ear, it is bigger than any thing you ever saw! And
they say of the lions, that the more their ears are buried
in bone the bolder they are. Why, at the time
I am speaking of, there were five hundred horsemen
about in the neighbouring villages, and they killed
three men, one between the house and the village, one
at the back of my premises, and one other farther off,
just to let me know what they could do, thinking
to terrify me; but I showed them I was not to
be frightened. I always slept with a khanjàr” (a
poniard) “by my side, and slept as sound as a top.
Poor Williams was terrified out of her senses: she
used to get up in the night and come to me. Why
do I keep Seyd Ahmed but on account of his courage?
because, in these dangerous times, you must have
servants of all sorts. I remember when I and Miss
Williams were left without a farthing of money, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
the Emir had surrounded the house with the intention
of murdering us, that Seyd Ahmed remained at
his post, when all the rest were so frightened they did
not know what they did; and we had nothing to eat
too, but he never complained. Once, when we were
at Abra, all the black slaves formed a plot to run
away in the night to Sayda, which they executed. I
had rung my bell several times, and, as nobody
answered it, I went out to look, thinking they were
all asleep, for it was two in the morning. Not a
soul was to be found except the little black boy. I
awoke Seyd Ahmed, called Miss Williams; and,
although Seyd Ahmed was in a terrible fury, and
wanted to set off in search of them in the middle of
the night, I would not let him: for I thought it was
a plot of the Emir’s to get the men out of the house,
and then to have us murdered. But all these matters
never disturbed my equanimity—I was as collected as
I am now.”</p>

<p>Once some camels, that Lady Hester had sent
with a load to a neighbouring seaport, were returning
light, when some persons, who were employed by
the Emir Beshýr, and who were accustomed to see the
richest individuals of the province eager to embrace
any opportunity of obliging him, thinking that she
would be delighted that her camel-drivers should have
rendered any assistance to their prince, stopped the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
camels, and loaded them with marble slabs, that were
intended for the floor of a part of the Emir’s new
palace, then building. These the drivers were ordered
to deposit on Lady Hester’s premises, where
they would be sent for. As soon as she heard that
the slabs were lying near her porter’s lodge, she went
out, and had them broken to pieces. “You may
guess,” said she, when she told the story, “what
a face the Prince made when this was related to
him.”</p>

<p>There was a man, named Girius Baz, who was
prime-minister to the Emir Beshýr; and, being an
ambitious man, who sold his services to the injury of
his master, he was strangled by him, and his goods
and property, as far as they could be come at, were
confiscated. The widow was left in poverty and
destitution, as it was generally believed; and Lady
Hester, having one day desired me to give two
hundred piasters to her son, a lad, who had come
begging in a genteel way, told me the following
<span class="lock">story:—</span></p>

<p>“That son,” said she, “was about eight or ten years
old when his father was killed, and, since he has
grown up, he maintains his mother by weaving. To
succour this distressed family was a dangerous business
with a man so cruel and jealous as the Emir; but
I did it. One day, I asked one of the Emir’s officers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
why his master had so little compassion on Baz’s
widow! ‘Because,’ answered the officer, ‘she goes
about, saying she does not like the Emir.’—‘Like
him!’ said I; ‘how can she like the man who murdered
her husband? If she said she liked the Emir, it
must be a lie, and therefore she only speaks the
truth. Why did the Emir put it out of her power to
like him?’—‘Because,’ replied the officer, ‘the minister
became more powerful than his master, and
then it was necessary to get rid of him.’—‘If he was
too powerful,’ resumed I, ‘it was the Emir’s fault: he
should have kept him under.’—‘But he could not,’
retorted the man.—‘Then, by your own confession,’
continued I, ‘he rode on the Emir’s shoulders; but
that was no reason why he should have had him
killed in a——.’—‘He was not killed in a——,’ interrupted
the officer; ‘he was only seized there, and
afterwards killed in his room.’—This was precisely
what I wanted to get out,” added Lady Hester; “I
made the man confess that the Emir <em>had</em> murdered
Girius Baz, and it was of no consequence to me when,
how, or where.</p>

<p>“Poor woman!” cried Lady Hester, after a pause,
returning to the widow’s case, “I once had her for
four months with me here, but she was so overwhelming
in her gratitude and thanks, and kept so constantly
about me, to attend upon me, that I was obliged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
to send her home again. Would you think it,
that even in this case the sufferers proved themselves
almost as bad as the tyrant! for this very
woman carried on the farce of abject poverty for two
years, and, at the end of that time, all of a sudden,
appeared the diamonds, shawls, and money, she had
hitherto concealed; in fact, she turned out almost as
rich as I was myself. There is no believing a word
you hear from any of them. Even Gondolfi<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> assured
me that, in all his life, and in no other country, had
he seen a people so full of lying, theft, and all kinds
of vice as these are; and this, to crown all, is what
he said of the Emir himself:—‘I have known him,’
said he, ‘twenty years, and never was there a more
heartless, cruel man. I took an opportunity of talking
to him in private, after he had put out his nephews’
eyes, and told him what an execrable thing it was.
He beat his breast, and professed such repentance for
what he had done, that I was quite moved, and
thought to myself, perhaps the man acted from what
he considered necessity, and that surely he would be
more humane in future. But, soon after, I heard of
the murder of Girius Baz, and of half a dozen more
enormities, and I felt persuaded that his hypocrisy
was as great as his cruelty.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
“You are shocked,” continued Lady Hester, “and
say you are sick at your stomach from hearing of the
atrocities of Ibrahim Pasha’s governors in getting
recruits. Oh, they are nothing to what the Emir
Beshýr has done in his time! Think of women’s
breasts squeezed in a vice; of men’s heads screwed
into a tourniquet until their temple-bones were
driven in; of eyes put out with red-hot saucers; and
a hundred other barbarities, worse than any you ever
heard of! Wasn’t it extraordinary, that the same
day that I sent the Emir’s man away with such a
message to his master, one of the house-dogs pupped,
and one of the puppies was blind?—not blind, as
puppies usually are, but with his eyes burnt out, just
as if they had been seared with a red-hot iron. I
said to the man, ‘The demon of your Prince has
entered the very dogs.’ The man almost fainted
away before I had done with him, for I was not afraid
of them; and even now, weak as I am, I do believe I
could strangle the strongest of them.</p>

<p>“The Emir Beshýr has duped everybody. He
duped the Pasha with the Sultan, and duped the
Sultan with the Pasha. He cheats the English, cheats
the French, and cheats all round. There is not a
greater hypocrite on the face of the earth; and,
although he sends his compliments to me by every
traveller that passes, he is only waiting to see what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
turn matters will take, to fall on me, if he can; and,
if he cannot, to lie and cringe, until a safer opportunity
occurs of taking his revenge.</p>

<p>“You knew Aubin, the French navy surgeon, who
had been a prisoner in the hulks at Portsmouth, and
used to abuse the English so. Well, he was made
the Emir’s doctor, because he procured him a ship to
fly to Egypt in; the events on the mountain here
succeeded each other so rapidly after your first
leaving me! About 1820, Abdallah Pasha having
hostile intentions against the Emir Beshýr and the
Sheykh Beshýr, they both fled to the Horàn; and,
after some time, when the Pasha pretended to be
pacified, they both returned. Soon after that, the
Emir, not being quite sure of what Abdallah Pasha
meditated, thought it safest to fly a second time; and
it was by the assistance of Monsieur Aubin that he
embarked for Egypt, on board of a French merchant-vessel,
commanded, I believe, by a Captain Allard.
The Sheykh Beshýr, finding his former domineering
rival fled, assumed the supreme authority in the
mountain, and told the Emir Beshýr, by letter, that,
if he ventured to return, he, the Sheykh, should be
obliged to have him arrested, and sent prisoner to the
Pasha.</p>

<p>“The Emir Beshýr, on arriving in Egypt, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
coldly received at first, as it was said, by Mahomet
Ali; but afterwards, having induced the Viceroy to
believe that he could put him in possession of Acre
and all Syria, he was, by Mahomet Ali’s money and
mediation, restored to his principality. It was then
that the plan for the conquest of Syria was concocted
in secret between them. The Emir, on his return,
contrived to recover his ascendency over the Sheykh
Beshýr; and, picking a quarrel with him, he succeeded
in taking him prisoner, and sent him in chains
to Acre, where Abdallah Pasha finally cut his head
off. At the same time, the Emir, to complete the
ruin of the Sheykh’s party, mutilated the young
Princes, who had shown themselves the Sheykh’s
partisans. The Sheykh’s wife fled; and Aâlm-ed-dyn,
a Druze, whom he employed in the execution of his
bloody barbarities, was sent after her, and told to
bring her son, a little boy, cost what it would. ‘Let
me see him cut in pieces before my eyes,’ said the
sanguinary wretch. The tyrant! he never sleeps
without a number of guards round his person. His
wife died soon after, and he sent a confidential agent
to Constantinople, and bought two young Georgian
slaves, he then being past eighty; and, after having
both with him to see which he liked best, he took one
of them as his favourite. It was for them that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>

Lady Hester Stanhope’s hours of sleep—Her night-dress—Irksomeness

clocks—Her frequent use of the bell—Her aptitude in discovering
and frustrating plots—Blind obedience required by
her—Anecdote of Lord S.—Lady Hester’s colloquial powers—Interminable

</p>

<p class="p2">For the last fifteen years of her life, Lady Hester
Stanhope seldom quitted her bed till between two and
five o’clock in the afternoon, nor returned to it before
the same hours the next morning. The day’s business
never could be said to have well begun until sunset.
But it must not be supposed that the servants were
suffered to remain idle during daylight. On the
contrary, they generally had their work assigned
them over-night, and the hours after sunset were
employed by her ladyship in issuing instructions as
to what was to be done next day; in giving orders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
scoldings, writing letters, and holding those interminable
conversations which filled so large a portion
of her time, and seemed so necessary to her life.
When these were over, she would prepare herself
to go to bed, but always with an air of unwillingness,
as if she regretted that there were no more commands
to issue, and nothing more that she could talk about.
When she was told that her room was ready, one of
the two girls, <i>Zezefôon</i> or <i>Fatôom</i>, who by turns
waited on her, would then precede her with the lights
to her chamber.</p>

<p>Her bedstead was nothing but planks nailed together
on low trestles. A mattress, seven feet long
and about four and a half broad, was spread on these
planks, which were slightly inclined from head to foot.
Instead of sheets, she had Barbary blankets, which
are like the finest English ones, two over her, and one
under. There was no counterpane, but, as occasion
required, a woollen <i>abah</i>, or cloak, or a fur pelisse
would be used for that purpose. Her pillow-case was
of Turkish silk, and under it was another covered in
coloured cotton. Behind this were two more of silk,
ready at hand, if wanted.</p>

<p>Her night-dress was a chemise of silk and cotton,
a white quilted jacket, a short pelisse, a turban on her
head, and a kefféyah tied under her chin in the same
manner as when she was up, and a shawl over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
back of her head and shoulders. Thus she slept nearly
dressed.</p>

<p>As it had become a habit with her to find nothing
well done, when she entered her bed-room, it was
rarely that the bed was made to her liking; and,
generally, she ordered it to be made over again in
her presence. Whilst this was doing, she would
smoke her pipe, then call for the sugar-basin to eat
two or three lumps of sugar, then for a clove to take
away the mawkish taste of the sugar. The girls, in
the mean time, would go on making the bed, and
be saluted every now and then, for some mark of
stupidity, with all sorts of appellations. The night-lamp
was then lighted; a couple of yellow wax lights
were placed ready for use in the recess of the window;
and, all things being apparently done for the night,
she would get into bed, and the maid, whose turn it
was to sleep in the room, (for, latterly, she always had
one) having placed herself, dressed as she was, on her
mattress behind the curtain which ran across the room,
the other servant was dismissed.</p>

<p>But hardly had she shut the door and reached her
own sleeping-room, flattering herself that her day’s
work was over, when the bell would ring, and she was
told to get broth, or lemonade, or orgeat directly.
This, when brought, was a new trial for the maids.
Lady Hester Stanhope took it on a tray placed on her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
lap as she sat up in bed, and it was necessary for one
of the two servants to hold the candle in one hand
and shade the light from her mistress’s eyes with
the other. The contents of the basin were sipped
once or twice and sent away; or, if she ate a small
bit of dried toast, it was considered badly made,
and a fresh piece was ordered, perhaps not to be
touched.</p>

<p>This being removed, the maid would again go away,
and throw herself on her bed; and, as she wanted no
rocking, in ten minutes would be sound asleep. But,
in the mean time, her mistress has felt a twitch in
some part of her body, and ding dong goes the bell
again. Now, as servants, when fatigued, do sometimes
sleep so soundly as not to hear, and sometimes are purposely
deaf, Lady Hester Stanhope had got in the
quadrangle of her own apartments a couple of active
fellows, a part of whose business it was to watch
by turns during the night, and see that the maids
answered the bell: they were, therefore, sure to be
roughly shaken out of their sleep, and, on going, half
stupid, into her ladyship’s room, would be told to
prepare a fomentation of chamomile, or elder flowers,
or mallows, or the like. The gardener was to be
called, water was to be boiled, and the house again
was all in motion. During these preparations, perhaps
Lady Hester Stanhope would recollect some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
order she had previously given about some honey,
or some flower, or some letter—no matter however
trifling—and whoever had been charged with the
execution of it was to be called out of his bed, whatever
the hour of the night might be, to be cross-questioned
about it. There was no rest for anybody
in her establishment, whether they were placed within
her own quadrangle, or outside of it. Dar Jôon was
in a state of incessant agitation all night.</p>

<p>These details are unimportant in themselves, but
they are significant in a high degree of her ladyship’s
peculiarity of character; and, as we have touched
upon the incidents of her bed-room, which was, for
most purposes, her principal apartment, it may be as
well to complete the description by a few additional
particulars. The room bore no resemblance to an
English or a French chamber, and, independently of
its rude furniture, it was, in another sense, hardly
better than a common peasant’s. Its appearance,
when illness confined its occupant to her bed, was
something of this sort; for I often entered it, early
in the morning, before breakfast. On the floor, which
was of cement, the common flooring of Syria, lay,
upon an Egyptian mat, a large oblong bit of drab felt,
of the size of a bedside carpet, called in Arabic <dfn>libàd</dfn>,
and a thick coarse chintz cushion, from which her
black slave, Zezefôon, had just risen, and where she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
had slept by her mistress’s bedside; the slave having
this privilege over the maid, who always slept behind
the curtain. This dirty red cotton curtain was suspended
by a common cord across the room, to keep
off the wind when the door opened, most of the curtain-ring
tapes being torn off: so that the curtain
hung, alternately suspended here, and dangling there,
a testimony of the little time the maids found for
mending. There were three windows to the room;
one was nailed up by its shutter on the outside, and
one closed up by a bit of felt on the inside: the third
only was reserved for the admission of light and air,
looking on the garden. In two deep niches in the
wall (for the walls of houses in Syria are often three
feet thick), were heaped on a shelf, equidistant from
the top and bottom, a few books, some bundles tied
up in handkerchiefs, writing-paper—all in confusion,
with sundry other things of daily use; such as a
white plate, loaded with several pair of scissors, two
or three pair of spectacles, &amp;c.; and another white
plate, with pins, sealing-wax, wafers; with a common
white inkstand, and the old parchment cover of some
merchant’s day-book, with blotting-paper inside, by
way of a blotting-book, in which, spread on her lap,
as she sat up in bed, she generally wrote her letters.
These places were seldom swept out, and dust and cobwebs
covered the books, into none of which, I believe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
she ever looked, excepting Tissot’s <i lang="fr">Avis au Peuple</i>,
another medical book, the title of which I have forgotten,
the Court Calendar, a Bible, and a Domestic
Cookery. The ground was strewed with small
bundles; gown-pieces of silk, or coloured cotton,
which she destined as presents; bits of twine, and
brown paper, left from day to day, from packages which
had been undone, &amp;c.</p>

<p>She had no watch, clock, or timepiece; and generally
the last words, when I left her in the evening,
were, “Doctor, tell me what it is o’clock before you
go.” I took the liberty of asking her why she had
not sent for a watch or timepiece during the number
of years she had remained on Mount Lebanon, a thing
so necessary every where, but especially in a solitary
house, where the <dfn>muezzim</dfn><a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> could not be heard, as in
towns. “Because I cannot bear any thing that is
unnatural,” was her answer; “the sun is for the day,
and the moon and stars for the night, and by them I
like to measure time.” Upon another occasion, she
said, “I never should be induced to go into a steamboat;
I, who have seen five men killed by the explosion
of a boiler, and I don’t know how many more
wounded and scalded, have always a dread about me.
Besides, I like nothing but nature.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
On a wooden stool, which served as a table, by
the bedside, stood a variety of things to satisfy her
immediate wants or fancies; such as a little strawberry
preserve in a saucer, lemonade, chamomile tea,
ipecacuanha lozenges, a bottle of cold water, &amp;c. Of
these she would take one or other in succession,
almost constantly. In a day or two they would be
changed for other messes or remedies. There would
be a bottle of wine, or of violet syrup; aniseeds to
masticate, instead of cloves; quince preserve; orgeat;
a cup of cold tea, covered over by the saucer; a
pill-box, &amp;c.; and so thickly was the wooden stool
covered, that it required the greatest dexterity to
take up one thing without knocking down half a
dozen others. And, in this respect, the noiseless
movements and dexterity of the Syrian and black
women pass all imagination. For months together
nothing of this assemblage would be upset or broken;
whilst a blundering Frank (Lady Hester would often
say) could not come into a room without tumbling
over her pipe, hooking his foot in the carpet or mat,
pitching forward against the table, and manifesting all
that European clumsiness, upon which she so delighted
to expatiate.</p>

<p>Her bed had no curtains, no mosquito net. An
earthenware <dfn>ybrick</dfn>, or jug, with a spout, stood in one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
of the windows, with a small copper basin, and this
was her washing apparatus. The room had no table
for the toilet, or any other purpose; and, when she
washed herself, the copper basin was held before her
as she sat up in bed. There were no curtains to the
windows; and the felt with which one of them was
covered was kept in its place by a faggot-stick, stuck
tightly in from corner to corner, diagonally. Such
was the chamber of Lord Chatham’s grand-daughter!
Diogenes himself could not have found fault with its
appointments!</p>

<p>I see I have omitted, in the enumeration of the
furniture, to mention a necessary appendage, often so
ornamental in English rooms—I mean, bellropes. Lady
Hester Stanhope’s room had one, a common hempen
cord, such as is customarily used for cording boxes.
It was reeved through a wooden pulley, screwed into
the centre of the ceiling, and came down slanting to
the wall, where it was tied to a rusty hook; the bend,
within her reach, was thickly knotted, so that she
might the more easily lay hold of it. Nor was it
made so strong and stout without good reason; for
she lugged at it sometimes with a degree of violence
and vigour, that would have snapped whipcord in
two; and seldom did a servant leave her room without
being rung back again, once, twice, or thrice—so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
impatient was her ladyship’s temper, and in such
quick succession did her ideas rise in her mind upon
every order she had to give.</p>

<p>Worn out with the fatigue of ringing, talking, and
scolding, at length Lady Hester Stanhope would fall
asleep; all would be hushed, and so the silence would
continue for three, four, or five hours. But, soon
after sun-rise, the bell would ring violently again, and
the business of the morning would commence. This
was a counterpart of the night, only that the few hours’
sleep gave her a fresh supply of vigour and activity.
As she seldom rose until four or five in the afternoon,
the intervening hours were occupied in writing, talking,
and receiving people; for, as she then sat up in her
bed, her appearance was pretty much the same as if
she had been on a sofa, to which her bed bore some
resemblance. She would see, one after another, her
steward, her secretary, the cook, the groom, the doctor,
the gardener, and, upon some occasions, the whole
household. Few escaped without a reproof and a
scolding; her impatience, and the exactitude she
required in the execution of her commands, left no one
a chance of escape. Quiet was an element in which a
spirit so restless and elastic could not exist. Secret
plans, expresses with letters, messengers on distant
journeys, orders for goods, succour and relief afforded
to the poor and oppressed—these were the aliments of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
her active and benevolent mind. No one was secure
of eating his meals uninterruptedly; her bell was constantly
ringing, and the most trifling order would keep
a servant on his legs, sometimes a whole hour, before
her, undergoing every now and then a cross-examination
worse than that of a Garrow.</p>

<p>In the same day, I have frequently known her to
dictate, with the most enlarged political views, papers
that concerned the welfare of a pashalik; and the next
moment she would descend, with wondrous facility,
to some trivial details about the composition of a
house-paint, the making of butter, the drenching of
a sick horse, the choosing lambs, or the cutting out of
a maid’s apron. She had a finger in everything, and
in everything was an adept. Her intelligence really
seemed to have no limits; the recesses of the universe,
if one might venture to say so, absolutely seemed
thrown open to her gaze. In the same manner that
she frustrated the intrigues and braved the menaces of
hostile Emirs and Pashas, did she penetrate and expose
the tricks and cunning of servants and peasants,
who were ever plotting to pilfer her. It was curious
to see what pains she would take in developing and
bringing to light a conspiracy of the vile wretches,
who, from time to time, laid their deep schemes of
plunder—schemes to which European establishments
have no parallel, and machinations which Satan himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
could hardly have counteracted. She used to say,
“there are half a dozen of them whom I could hang,
if I chose;” but she was forbearing to culprits, when
she once had them in her power, although unwearied
and unflinching in her pursuit of them.</p>

<p>No soul in her household was suffered to utter a
suggestion on the most trivial matter—even on the
driving of a nail into a bit of wood: none were
permitted to exercise any discretion of their own, but
strictly and solely to fulfil their orders. Nothing
was allowed to be given out by any servant without
her express directions. Her dragoman or secretary
was enjoined to place on her table each day an
account of every person’s employment during the
preceding twenty-four hours, and the names and
business of all goers and comers. Her despotic
humour would vent itself in such phrases as these.
The maid one day entered with a message—“The
gardener, my lady, is come to say that the piece of
ground in the bottom is weeded and dug, and he says
that it is only fit for lettuce, beans, or <dfn>selk</dfn>, [a kind of
lettuce] and such vegetables.” “Tell the gardener,”
she answered vehemently, “that when I order him to
dig, he is to dig, and not to give his opinion what the
ground is fit for. It may be for his grave that he
digs, it may be for mine. He must know nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
until I send my orders, and so bid him go about his
business.”</p>

<p>The consequence of all this was, she was pestered
from morning till night, always complaining she had
not even time to get up, and always making work for
herself. Here is another example. A maid, named
Sâada, was desired to go to the store-room man, and
ask for fourteen sponges. She went, and added, out of
her own head when she delivered the message, “fourteen
to wipe the drawing-room mats with”—it being
customary in the Levant (and an excellent custom it
is) to clean mats with wet sponges. In the course of
the day, this slight variation in the message came to
Lady Hester’s ears, and she instantly sent for the
culprit, and, telling her that she would teach her for
the future how she would dare to vary in a single word
from any message she had to deliver, she ordered the
girl’s nose to be rubbed on the mats, while this injunction
was impressed on her, that, whatever the words
of a message might be, she was never to deviate from
them, to add to them, or to take from them, but to
deliver them strictly as she received them. In fact,
she maintained that the business of a servant was, not
to think, but simply to obey.</p>

<p>Truly did old General Loustaunau say sometimes
that, with all her greatness and her talents, there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
not a more wretched being on earth. People have often
asked me how she spent her life in such a solitude:
the little that has already been related will show that
time seldom hung heavily on her hands, either with
her or those about her.</p>

<p>In reference to the blind obedience she required
from servants, Lady Hester Stanhope one day said to
me, “Did I ever tell you the lecture Lord S*******
gave me? He and Lady S—— had taken me home
to their house from the opera. It was a cold snowy
night; and, after I had remained and supped <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>
with them, when it was time to go, owing to some
mistake in the order, my carriage never came for me;
so Lord S—— said his should take me home. When
he rang for the footman to order it out, I happened to
observe, ‘The poor coachman, I dare say, is just got
warm in his bed, and the horses are in the middle of
their feed; I am sorry to call him out on such a
night as this.’ After the man had left the room,
Lord S—— turned to me and said, ‘My dear Lady
Hester, from a woman of your good sense, I should
never have thought to hear such an observation. It
is never right to give a reason for an order to a
servant. Take it for a rule through life that you are
never to allow servants to expect such a thing from
you: they are paid for serving, and not for whys and
wherefores.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
When Lady Hester Stanhope got up, increasing
attention to her own personal wants through long
years of bad health had rendered her a being of such
sensitiveness, that a thousand preparations were
necessary for her comfort; and herein consisted the
irksomeness of the service for those about her. Yet
this, if ever it was pardonable in any person, was
surely so in her; for her nature seemed to lay claim
to obedience from all inferior creatures, and to exact
it by some talismanic power, as the genii in Eastern
tales hold their familiar spirits in subjection.</p>

<p>The marked characteristic of Lady Hester Stanhope’s
mind was the necessity she was under of
eternally talking. This is a feature in her life to which
justice can hardly be done by description. Talking
with her appeared to be as involuntary and unavoidable
as respiration. So long as she was awake, her
brain worked incessantly, and her tongue never knew
a moment’s repose. It might be supposed that such
a perpetual flow and outpouring of words must lead
to the unconscious disclosure of every thought and
feeling; but it was not so with Lady Hester Stanhope.
Her control over her expressions was wonderful,
in spite of her impetuous volubility. Her tongue was
anything but the frank interpreter of her thoughts;
it seemed rather to be given to her, upon Talleyrand’s
principle, to conceal them; it was the tongue of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
syren, always employed in misleading the hearer, and
in conducting him to some unexpected conclusion by a
roundabout road, or through a labyrinth of words, in
which she would inextricably entangle him, until, at
length, to his amazement, he found himself at some
point, which he had never thought of before, or which
he had been all along trying to avoid.</p>

<p>Her conversations lasted six and eight hours at a
time, without moving from her seat; so that, although
highly entertained, instructed, or astonished as the
listeners might be, it was impossible not to feel the
weariness of so long a sitting. Everybody who has
visited Lady Hester Stanhope in her retirement will
bear witness to her unexampled colloquial powers; to
her profound knowledge of character; to her inexhaustible
fund of anecdotes; to her talents for mimicry;
to her modes of narration, as various as the
subjects she talked about; to the lofty inspirations
and sublimity of her language, when the subject required
it; and to her pathos and feeling, whenever she
wished to excite the emotions of her hearers. There
was no secret of the human heart, however studiously
concealed, that she could not discover; no workings
in the listener’s mind that she would not penetrate;
no intrigue, from the low cunning of vulgar artifices
to the vast combinations of politics, that she would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
not unravel; no labyrinth, however tortuous, that she
would not thread.</p>

<p>It was this comprehensive and searching faculty,
this intuitive penetration, which made her so formidable;
for, under imaginary names, when she wished
to show a person that his character and course of life
were unmasked to her view, she would, in his very
presence, paint him such a picture of himself, in drawing
the portrait of another, that you might see the
individual writhing on his chair, unable to conceal the
effect that her words had on his conscience. Everybody
who heard for an hour or two retired humbled
from her presence; for her language was always directed
to bring mankind to their level, to pull down
pride and conceit, to strip off the garb of affectation,
and to shame vice, immorality, irreligion, and hypocrisy.</p>

<p>In the latter years of her life, social and unrestrained
conversation was out of the question—it was
difficult to unbend before her—to spend a couple of
hours with her was to go to school. She was unceasingly
employed in laying bare the weaknesses of
our common nature. Mercy, in the sense of tenderness
for people’s foibles, she had none; but, to her
honour be it said, although she was constantly drawing
a line between the high and low born, good qualities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
in the most menial person bore as high an estimation
in her mind, as if she had discovered them in
princes.</p>

<p>It was wonderful how long she would hold a person
in conversation, listening to her anecdotes and remarks
on human life; she seemed entirely to forget
that the listener could possibly require a respite or
even a temporary relief. It may be alleged that nothing
was more easy than to find excuses for breaking
up a parley of this sort; but it was not so—for her
words ran on in such an uninterrupted stream, that
one never could seize a moment to make a pause. I
have sat more than eight, ten—nay, twelve and thirteen
hours, at a time! Lady Hester Stanhope told
me herself, that Mr. Way<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> remained, one day, from
three in the afternoon until break of day next morning,
<i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> with her; and Miss Williams once
assured me that Lady Hester kept Mr. N. (an
English gentleman, who was her doctor some time)
so long in discourse that he fainted away. Her ladyship’s
readiness in exigencies may be exemplified by
what occurred on that occasion. When she had rung
the bell, and servants had come to her assistance, she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
said very quietly to them, that, in listening to the
state of disgrace to which England was reduced by
the conduct of the Ministers (this was in 1818-19),
his feelings of shame and grief had so overpowered
him, that he had fainted. Mr. N., however, declared
to Miss W. that it was no such thing, but that he
absolutely swooned away from fatigue and constraint.</p>

<p>Her conversations were generally familiar and colloquial,
sometimes sarcastic, sometimes rising to eloquence
so noble and dignified, that, like an overflowing
river, it bore down everything before it. Her illustrations
were drawn from every sensible or abstract
thing, and were always most felicitous. Her reasoning
was so plain, as to be comprehended and followed
by the most illiterate person, at the same time that it
was strictly logical, and always full of strength and
energy. She had read all subjects without books, and
was learned without lore; and, to sum up all, if she
was mad, as many people believed, she was, like the
cracked Portland vase, more valuable, though damaged,
than most perfect vessels.</p>

<p>These dialogues may not, perhaps, read so well
upon paper as they sounded to the ear when she spoke
them. The flexibility of her features, the variety of
her tones, her person, her dignified manner, her
mimicry—all contributed towards the effect. Sometimes,
after being deeply impressed with her discourse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
I have gone from her, and immediately put it down in
writing, word for word; but it never seemed to me
the same thing.</p>

<p>It was often necessary to bear with great superciliousness
and arrogance in her manner, and she might
be said to be the most deliberately affronting person
that ever existed, for she would say anything to anybody.
Few, however, thought proper to put themselves
in a passion, for she generally hit right. I
have known her call a prince a <i lang="fr">coquin</i> to his face.
Nobody could despise her powers of argument, and
her superiority of intellect. Her quickness of perception
between right and wrong was indubitable; but,
when she chose it, her sophistry was no less subtile
and irresistible.</p>

<p>In the following diary, as much as possible of what
fell from her on different subjects has been preserved.
To have written down all would have required as
many scribes as there are reporters for a daily newspaper.
“Thoughts come into my head as wind
comes in at the window,” Lady Hester used to say.
Topic succeeded topic, one thing followed another,
and it required a tenacious memory to retain such a
profusion of matter, and much leisure to put it on
paper.</p>

<p>The religious opinions of a person like Lady Hester
Stanhope may probably be an object of curiosity to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
those who consider a man’s mode of faith the true
criterion by which to estimate him. As far, however,
as professed creeds went, it is doubtful whether
she ever subscribed to any. She was accustomed to
say, “What my religion is nobody knows. Jews
and Christians have tried me hard, and questioned me
pretty closely, but they were not wiser when they
ended than when they began.”</p>

<p>“Doctor,” one day she said to me, “you have no
religion—what I mean by religion is, adoration of
the Almighty. Religion, as people profess it, is nothing
but a dress. One man puts on one coat, and
another another; but the feeling that I have is quite
a different thing, and I thank God that he has opened
my eyes. You will never learn of me, because you
cannot comprehend my ideas, and therefore it is of no
use teaching you. Nobody opens a book to an idiot,
that would spit and splutter over it; for you never
could make him read. Ah!—I see my way a little
before me, and God vouchsafes to enlighten me perhaps
more than other people.</p>

<p>“I know my own imperfections and my own merits;
and I hope, by rendering myself pure in thought and
deed, to become acceptable in the eyes of God. In
all my gaieties, I was always the same as I am now.
I saw there was a system of mythology, a system of
medicine, of politics, of all sorts of things; but they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
did not satisfy me, and I used to say to myself I
must find all this out. I know now a great deal more
than I did then; and, if I were to sit down to dictate
all I know, it would take me two years to do it. Yet,
after all, when I look round and see the boundless
extent of knowledge, I feel my own littleness. But
what are half the people in the world? I hold them
in the most sovereign contempt. Sir J. Mackintosh,
who makes a speech, and makes a talk at a dinner-table,
and then says he doesn’t know what about
witchcraft—he may say what he likes, but there are
evil spirits in mankind. Go into a madhouse!—all
madnesses are not alike—and where you suspect the
presence of an evil spirit.... But there, you will go
and speak of these things to common persons, who
will make fun of it, just as Dr. Madden and Dr. Clarke
did....”</p>

<p>She went on, “I never can imagine that all the
celebrated Greeks and Romans were a pack of old
women; and therefore what they believed in must be
as good as what other people believe in. But many,
who see these things with the same eyes as I do, are
still in the dark. It is like that looking-glass—everybody
knows it reflects his face, but many do not know
how and in what manner that is effected. Now I
understand all the heathen mythology, not from
reading about it, or hearing people talk about it, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
from my own penetration and the depth of my reflections.
And, if I could but get hold of some
books that would give me the opinions and doctrines
of all the ancient philosophers, I would then write
down my own, and would support them by quotations;
as thus—such a thing is so and so, and Plato, or
Socrates, or Cicero, or somebody else, has such a
passage in confirmation of what I assert.</p>

<p>“It was ever an object with me to search out why
I came into the world; what I ought to do in it, and
where I shall go to. God has given me the extraordinary
faculty of seeing into futurity; for a clear
judgment becomes matter of fact. It has ever been
my study to know myself. I may thank God for my
sufferings, as they have enabled me to dive deeper
into the subject than, I believe, any person living.
The theory of the soul, doctor, what an awful
thing!</p>

<p>“My religion is to try to do as well as I can in
God’s eyes. That is the only merit I have: I try to
do the best I can. Some of the servants sometimes
talk about my religion—<i>dyn es Syt</i>,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> as they call it—and
I let them talk; for they explain it to people
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
by saying, it is to do what is right, and to avoid all
uncleanliness.</p>

<p>“My views of the Creator are very different. I
believe that all things are calculated, and what is
written is written; but I do not suppose that the
devil is independent of God: he receives his orders.
Not that God goes and gives them to him, any more
than the big my lord goes and gives orders to his
shoeblack. There is some secondary being that does
that—some <i lang="fr">intendant</i>.</p>

<p>“There are angels of different degrees, from the
highest down to the devil. It must be an awful
sight to see an angel! There is something so transcendent
and beautiful in them, that a person must
be half out of his senses to bear the sight. For,
when you are looking down, and happen to raise your
head, and there is the angel standing before you, you
can’t say whether it came up through the earth, or
down from the sky, or how—there he is, and may go
in the same way. But angels don’t appear to every
body. You know, doctor, you can’t suppose that, if
you were a little dirty apothecary, keeping a shop in
a narrow street, a prime minister would waste his
time in going to call on you; or that, if a man is
sitting over his glass all the evening, or playing whist,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
or lounging all the morning, an angel will come to
him. But when there is a mortal of high rectitude
and integrity, then such a being may be supposed to
condescend to seek him out.</p>

<p>“God is my friend—that is enough: and, if I am
to see no happiness in this world, my share of it, I
trust, will be greater in the next, if I am firm in the
execution of those principles which he has inspired me
with.”</p>

<p>Such were the religious opinions which Lady Hester
Stanhope expressed from time to time. There may
be observed in the lives of persons of extraordinary
political talents a disposition to believe in the possibility
of a class of agencies, which are generally considered
visionary by common capacities. This may
arise from the comparison they make between their
own intellectual faculties and those of common minds.
For, when they reflect how much superior they are to
the generality of mankind, how much farther they
can see into men’s projects, and what numberless
agents, unknown and unsuspected by the vulgar, they
call into action to effect their own plans and purposes,
they then set no bounds to the range of an omnipotent
being, and they fancy such a power to be served by
spirits as much invisible to themselves, as their spies
and creatures are unseen and unobserved by those
whom they influence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
It was so with Lady Hester Stanhope. She
managed whatever affair she undertook with impenetrable
mystery; and the hand that weighed down the
guilty or lifted up the oppressed was, when she
stretched it out, oftener felt than perceived. Hence,
probably, it was that her all-powerful mind had taken
a strong bias towards dæmonology, necromancy, and
magic. She seemed to entertain a firm belief that the
elements were filled with spirits, who watched over
and guided the steps and actions of men. The air we
move in, and the earth we tread on, she considered as
filled with delicate and aërial beings, by whom the
gentle and sage were rewarded and protected for the
amenity and prudence of their every-day movements
and actions, but who, in return, avenged themselves
on the wicked, nay, even on the awkward, by causing
the numberless bodily accidents which such persons
are liable to. “Never do I move a foot,” Lady
Hester would sometimes say, “but I ask these
guardian sylphs to watch over me; and never do I
see a blundering fellow knock his head against the
top of a doorway, but I think he is breaking some of
their delicate members. For, as a piece of valuable
china is generally set in a place where it may not be
easily knocked down, so do these spirits generally
perch where our steps may not molest them: and, as
a man who spits about a room commonly aims his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
saliva where he will not spoil the furniture, so should
we look that our motions and gestures do not injure
these unseen creatures; and hence it becomes us, in
what we do violently, to give them a kind of warning
to get out of the way.”</p>

<p>In this belief, Lady Hester still acknowledged the
Holy Scriptures as inspired writings; she quoted
from them as such, and may be said to have looked
into them oftener than into any other book. Thus,
in speaking of the resurrection, she drew her argument
from the New Testament. “There will be two
resurrections,” she used to say; “for the Scripture
mentions somewhere the first resurrection, and people
don’t talk of their first wife unless they have had a
second. The first resurrection will be such, that the
dead will rise, and walk on the earth, with the people
of it, in their accustomed forms and raiment; but, at
the second, they will all appear before the <dfn>Murdah</dfn>,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
and then will be the day of judgment.”</p>

<p>On another occasion, she exclaimed, “What wonderful
things those prophecies are in the Bible! To
think they should foretel events, and even people’s
names, so many hundred years before a thing happens!”</p>

<p>When the missionary, Mr. Way, was at Jôon,
Lady Hester and he talked together on religion for
several hours. “Mr. W.,” she said, “was clever and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
learned; but he, like the rest, fancied he was to effect
the conversion of men by his own efforts: they are all
mistaken. My scheme is quite different. I am but
an instrument in the hands of God, and, when he
pleases that the great change is to take place, he will
bring it to pass as he likes. My duty is to prepare
people’s minds; and, if I were to die to-morrow, I
should be contented if I thought I had made some
persons, at least, reflect.”</p>

<p>In some things, Lady Hester Stanhope had adopted
portions of the Jewish law, or perhaps of that of the
Mussulman sect of the Shyites. Several of her maid-servants
were taken from the neighbouring villages,
where there are a great many schismatic Mahometans,
called Metoualys; and in them she probably remarked
certain observances, about which she obtained fuller
explanations from the learned Sheykhs who occasionally
visited her; and she seems to have copied these observances
as useful rules of life, but not as religious
duties. The Metoualys have the terms <dfn>nidjez</dfn> and
<dfn>halal</dfn>, synonymous with <dfn>unclean</dfn> and <dfn>lawful</dfn>, constantly
in their mouths, and most of the laws respecting uncleanliness
in the Levitical code are followed by them.
Lady Hester Stanhope had imbibed many of these
prejudices, as will be seen from an example or two.</p>

<p>A gentleman, irreproachable on the score of cleanliness
and of refined manners, having arrived somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
unexpectedly at Jôon, the servants, in their
hurry to get his dinner, made use of some things
which belonged to her ladyship’s service. After
dining, the guest paid his visit to her, and then
retired to go to rest. It was nearly one in the morning.
From a word, casually dropped by the slave,
she discovered that some of her own dinner napkins
had been given out for her visitor. Such an uproar
began, as few people can imagine would ever spring
from so trifling a cause, and was hardly over by
daylight.</p>

<p>“What! is there no possibility,” she cried, “of
keeping anything to myself? I do insist, that everything
which regards other people may never be mixed
with what is for me. Neither shall water be boiled in
my kitchen, nor cooking go on there, nor saucepan,
dish, nor glass, that has once gone out for any one,
ever return there again.” The confusion lasted for
some hours after midnight; she had all her pots,
pans, tumblers, dishes, towels, knives and forks, every
article of the table or kitchen, brought in, and spread
before her, to teach them, as she said, by the trouble
they had, not to violate her orders again. But there
was reason to suppose that all these minute and exclusive
regulations were not attended to. She was
the dupe of the servants’ lies; and she once said, as if
in despair at not being able to enforce obedience,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
“Doctor, they wipe their noses, then the ...,
and then the drinking-glasses, in the same towel; and
lie, and lie, with an assurance that sets detection at
defiance.”</p>

<p class="p2">Her ladyship, in several conversations, took great
pains in acquainting me with all the material events
that had occurred during my absence in Europe, and
in what relation she stood with the pashas and governors
of the neighbouring towns and provinces, proceeding,
in succession, from occurrences relating to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
most exalted individuals, to those connected with the
lowest persons that surrounded her. She talked of
her debts, her illnesses, her trials and sufferings, and
never finished a day without picturing to herself a
brighter futurity, when her worth would be more
appreciated, when the clouds that overspread her
existence would be dissipated, and when the neglect in
which she was left by her friends would meet with its
just punishment, and her magnificent star rise again,
with renewed splendour, to gladden the world, and
those, more particularly, who had been faithful to her
cause. This buoyancy of spirits saved her from the
despondency which others, in her deserted state, must
inevitably have felt. The work of years to come was
chalked out in her active imagination; plans were
sketched; new channels of correspondence were to be
opened; her household was to be remodelled; fresh
buildings were to be raised; learned researches were to
be made: valuable manuscripts were to be procured.
It is impossible to say what was not projected; but
her faithful Miss Williams still rose uppermost in
her mind, and her first care was to see the last duties,
yet remaining, paid to her memory.</p>

<p>As that excellent person occupied an important
position in Lady Hester Stanhope’s house and affairs,
I will here make room for the following account of
her sickness and death, as it was given me by <i>Um <span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
Ayôob</i>, a respectable widow of Jôon. This woman
was in the habit of doing needlework at Lady Hester’s,
when she would pass whole days together at the
house. One day, as she and Miss W. were sitting in
the same room sewing (it was on a Friday), Miss W.
said to her, “Dear me, how cold I am—I am all in a
shiver!” The season (it being autumn) was very
sickly, and many of the servants were lying ill, one
being at the very time dangerously so with continued
bilious fever. The shivering, however, passed over.
Um Ayôob went home at night, and the following
day returned to her work. Miss W. was on her legs
again. The day after she had an attack of intermittent
fever. This was Sunday, and on Monday she was
pretty well again. Expecting the return of the fit on
Tuesday, the good widow asked Miss W. whether she
should remain with her; but Miss W. said “No:
your daughter has got an ague as well as myself; so
go, and attend upon her—she may want you in the
night; and come to me on Thursday, as to-morrow I
shall not require your services, for I intend to remain
quiet all the day.” So, on Wednesday, Um Ayôob
did not go. On Thursday she was baking, when a
servant came to her, and said, “Make haste, for God’s
sake! you are wanted to attend on Miss W.” As
the old lady’s bread was just baked, she thought she
would take a couple of hot cakes in a clean towel, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
the idea that Miss W. might like them buttered for
her breakfast. “So,” said Um Ayôob, when she told
me the melancholy story, “as I was hastening along the
bottom which divides the village from the Dar, I was met
by little <i>Gayby</i>, crying, ‘Oh, come, come—run, run!’—‘What’s
the matter?’ I asked.—‘Oh, oh! she’s dead!
she’s dead!’ sobbed Gayby.—‘Who’s dead?’ cried I,
terrified out of my senses.—‘Miss Williams,’ answered
she. I was struck with horror, and, quickening my
pace as fast as I could, I arrived out of breath, and
found the tale but too true—Miss Williams had
breathed her last.”</p>

<p>It appeared that, on Wednesday morning, Lady
Hester, who was herself ill in bed, had given orders to
the little girl, Gayby, to prepare, from the medicine-chest,
a dose of salts and senna, she being too ill to
see to it herself. This dose, according to the assertion
of <i>Nasara</i>, one of the maids, who waited on Miss
W., produced an extraordinary effect through the
day and night, and Miss W. was not free from its
action until she expired. Besides the black dose, she
took also three pills, but of what nature I could not
learn. The persons who attended on her were
Nasara, Gayby, and Fatôom, the Fatôom so often
named in these pages, who was at that time eleven or
twelve years old. Um Ayôob, who loved and regretted
Miss Williams (as indeed did almost everybody),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
sat by her corpse the remainder of the day.
In the course of the afternoon, she was surprised to
find that the body, so far from becoming cold, retained
almost its natural living heat. There happened
to arrive at Lady Hester’s the preceding day a
doctor of the country, who had been sent for to attend
on Moosa, the man-servant, then lying dangerously
ill, and who died two days after Miss W. Um Ayôob
called him into the room, and begged him to feel the
body, and say whether there was not yet life in it.
He was equally of opinion with the widow that the
appearances were very surprising, and the more especially
as the cheeks retained some colour, and (according
to Um Ayôob’s expression), as something kept
continually bubbling inside of her like boiling water.
The doctor went to Lady Hester and told her what
he had seen, and asked her permission to open a
vein. Lady Hester, who was overwhelmed with
affliction at the loss of a person so dear to her, said,
“Do what you please.” He accordingly opened a
vein in the foot, and the blood spirted out, said Um
Ayôob, as from a living person. After having taken
what he thought a sufficient quantity, he bound up
the incision; but life never returned, and on Sunday
she was buried in the burying-ground of the monastery
of Dayr el Mkhallas, the coffin being followed
by the French vice-consul and some merchants of
Sayda.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
I must here observe that the letting of blood was
an ill-judged expedient for restoring the living action,
because it only completed the exhaustion already carried
to its utmost point by the previous depletion of
the bowels. The case is not the same as when, after
a fall or an attack of apoplexy, the opening of a vein
may give an impulse to the suspended circulation, just
as a touch of the finger to the balance of a watch will
set it going when it has stopped. But here the vital
warmth should have been nourished and promoted by
every available means, and nature should have been
left to husband her internal resources until reanimation
had been effected.</p>

<p>In company with my family, I visited Miss
Williams’s grave, and could not forbear shedding
tears over it; for I had known her many years. She
was a creature of remarkable singleness of mind, of
<a id="chg3"></a>unstained purity, and so universally beloved that the
people of the neighbourhood and the peasantry talk
of her to this day as a model of virtue and goodness.
The only monument raised over her grave was a rude,
oval-shaped wall, topped with thorny shrubs, to keep
the jackalls from scratching for her corpse.</p>

<p>In the register of the monastery, they have (as I
was told) put her down as a Catholic, and had spread
a report that she had died in that faith, in order that
popular prejudice might raise no objection to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
lying in Catholic ground. Over the tomb a tamarisk-tree,
with its delicate, evergreen, feathery branches,
waves in the wind. A few tombs of venerable bishops,
devout merchants, and holy monks, stand in relief
from the rocky barrenness of the spot, with Arabic
inscriptions commemorative of their piety and virtues.
It is only to be regretted that some similar memorial
has not been raised to Miss Williams.</p>

<p>Miss Williams had now been dead more than two
years, and the room in which she died had never been
entered, from the hour that her corpse was carried out
of it. The door had been barred up by cross laths
nailed over it; and, from the circumstance of Lady
Hester Stanhope’s having repeatedly declared she
never could pass by the door again, a sort of dread
had crept over the maids and slaves, akin to that
which is common in England when a chamber of some
house is reported to be haunted. A breathless silence,
and expectation of something supernatural, accordingly
reigned in the quadrangle, when the carpenter
proceeded to knock away the laths, and, through
cobwebs and dust, I introduced, with some difficulty,
the rusty key into the keyhole, and, with considerable
effort, forced open the door. The floor was covered
with dust, and thick, long cobwebs hung across from
wall to wall: on the floor lay scattered in confusion a
few books, a hair-brush, and various papers. A sort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
of disorder was apparent in the furniture, such as
would arise in a room hastily left. A box of papers,
containing a list of Lady Hester Stanhope’s debts and
memoranda relating to them, lay open in a recess, and
seemed the last thing that had occupied Miss W.’s
attention; for, alas! the increasing embarrassment
of Lady’s Hester’s money concerns might naturally
be supposed to harass her mind, seeing that, at one
time, her noble patroness, bred in the lap of luxury,
had been reduced to the necessity of selling for their
weight (since they would not pass current), forty
English guineas, given to her by her brother James
when they parted, and saved when she was ship-wrecked,
not knowing, when they were gone, where to
look for a penny. An empty work-basket lay turned
upside down on the floor; and an air of desolation and
disorder in the room and closets showed that whatever
had been worth pilfering had been carried off by the
wicked servants during the time which elapsed between
her death and burial.</p>

<p>“Poor Miss Williams!” thought I; “what must
have been your sufferings at that sad hour, with no
one of your own country to close your eyes, and surrounded
by slaves and peasant women, who robbed you
instead of attending to your wants! Yet, with what
fidelity and attachment did you not follow your benefactress
from a comfortable home, where a happy circle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
regretted you, to endure the numberless privations
which constant confinement, want of society, and a
residence in an uncivilized country, necessarily bring
with them! Even I, had my earlier arrival not been
retarded, might have contributed to soothe your last
moments, if not to save your life!”</p>

<p>On opening the closets that were locked, her linen,
her writing-desk, her paint-box, and sundry other
articles were seen neatly arranged, as one would suppose
an English woman would place them. I unlocked
the desk, removed the papers, which her relatives had
written for, as well as some others that Lady Hester
thought I should find there; and, shutting the
closet again, withdrew with melancholy thoughts
on the uncertainty of human hopes, resolved to defer
until another day the inventory of her goods and
effects.</p>

<p>The next day, I remained with Lady Hester Stanhope
from eleven in the morning until ten at night,
the greater part of the time being employed in looking
over Miss W.’s papers, which consisted principally
of rough copies of letters dictated by her ladyship.</p>

<p>When I and my family were comfortably settled in
our little cottage in the village, Lady Hester appointed
a morning to receive Mrs. ——, on the occasion of
her first visit. On reaching the house, I conducted
her to the saloon, where, after introducing her, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
sitting a little while, I retired, in compliance with
Lady Hester’s usual custom of never liking to have
more than one person with her at a time. Here Mrs.
—— remained about three hours, and then took her
leave; and I, having sent her home under the care of
a servant, presented myself to hear Lady Hester’s
opinion about her, a necessary consequence that
always followed when any person quitted her whom
she had seen for the first time. Our conference lasted
until past midnight. The night proved very tempestuous:
the wind howled, the thunder rolled, the
rain beat against the shutters; and, when I returned
to the village, wet through, I found Mrs. —— sitting
disconsolate, and terrified at the war of the elements,
alone, as it were, in the midst of the horrors of the
night, and unable to make herself understood by the
slaves, who knew no language but Arabic.</p>

<p>Next morning, at breakfast, we talked over the conversation
that had passed between her and Lady
Hester Stanhope. Lady Hester had used the kindest
expressions; and, at the close of her visit, getting up
and ringing for a handsome Turkish spencer in gold
brocade, had put it on her with her own hands, and
had wound on her head a beautifully embroidered
muslin turban. Mrs. ——, not understanding Lady
Hester’s humours, who had in all this imitated the
Eastern manner of robing people when they go away,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
had taken them both off and left them on the table,
so that they were sent home the next day. This,
I knew, would be a grievous offence in Lady Hester’s
eyes.</p>

<p>Things, however, went on satisfactorily until the
25th of January, when a messenger came from Damascus,
sent by a person of an ancient and noble
family, named Ahmed Bey, beyt Admy,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> with a letter
to Lady Hester Stanhope, saying that, “her physician’s
arrival from England having been reported to
the Pasha, he, Ahmed Bey, had been solicited by his
highness to write to her, and request she would spare
the doctor, a short time, to cure a complaint with
which a friend of the Pasha’s, called Hassan Effendi,
Tâat ed Dyn, was afflicted in the roof of his mouth,
which was peculiarly painful to him, and a source
of deep regret to the faithful, in consequence of his
being one of the most distinguished chanters of the
Koran.”</p>

<p>This Ahmed Bey was a very old friend of Lady
Hester Stanhope’s, and a nobleman who had honoured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
me with his particular notice some years before, during
our stay at Damascus; she, therefore, laid great stress
on my going, and wished me to prepare immediately
for my departure.</p>

<p>As I did not think it right to leave my family for
three weeks or a month alone in a cottage, where no
human being could understand them, I suggested to
Lady Hester the propriety of writing a polite excuse
to Ahmed Bey, expressing my inability to comply
with his wishes for the present. But she had my
compliance so much at heart, that it was agreed she
should see Mrs. —— herself, and endeavour to remove
her scruples, flattering her she could contrive, with
her accustomed fertility in expedients for all difficulties,
some means to reconcile her to my departure, and
show her the groundlessness of her fears. Mrs. ——
accordingly paid a second visit to Lady Hester, who
began by endeavouring to act on her pride, by telling
her my reputation would be ruined among all the
Pashas, if I refused to go to a great man, like Hassan
Effendi, and that her own consequence would be
lessened; moreover, that our ambassador at Constantinople
would hear of it, and take it ill, with many
arguments of the like sort. Finding this mode of
reasoning had no effect, she tried to frighten her, by
assuring her very gravely that there were dervises,
who, interested in the well-being of holy men, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
especially of a chanter of the word of the Prophet,
would, by unknown charms, inflict all sorts of evils
upon her, make hair grow on her face, bring out
blotches on her body, &amp;c. The reader will be surprised,
when he is told that Lady Hester Stanhope
affected to believe all this. Mrs. —— lent a civil but
incredulous ear. Her ladyship then endeavoured to
engage her consent by holding out the benefits that
would accrue to me in a pecuniary light, and the
shawls and brocades that I probably should bring back
to her as presents from such grand folks. But the
foretaste of solitude in a village during winter, which
the many lonely evenings already passed there had
given her, was too strongly impressed on her mind,
and she respectfully but firmly answered, that, if I
chose to go, of course she could not help it, but that
it never could be without rendering her miserable:
upon which they parted, with no good will on her
ladyship’s side; and from that hour began a system
of hospitality to Mrs. ——, which never ceased until
our departure.</p>

<p>This leads me to say a word on the extraordinary
hatred that Lady Hester Stanhope bore to her own
sex, although from what cause I do not know: but
during her travels and her residence on Mount
Lebanon, in all the visits she received from persons
of whatever condition, their wives, if travelling with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
them, seldom or never obtained access. She professed
a general dislike to women, and said she had never
known but three, among the hundreds she had been
acquainted with, of whom she could speak with unreserved
admiration. Hence it was that she considered
married men as necessarily miserable, and how
often did she quote Sir —— ——’s case to illustrate
her views. That same evening she reproached me for
yielding to the idle fears of a woman, and painted very
ridiculous and amusing pictures of the henpecked husbands
she had known in her time, of whom the most
prominent was Lord ——, and the most suffering, the
baronet alluded to above. In conclusion, she told me
she should write an answer to Ahmed Bey, telling
him I was governed by my wife, and could not
come.</p>

<p>It was customary for her to send over to the village
every morning a servant and horse to fetch me; but
on the 26th, 27th, and 28th of January he did not
come; and I very well knew that some explosion of
anger would take place on her part: it being an unpardonable
thing in her eyes for any living being to
oppose her purposes, and much more for a woman to
do so. In the evening of the 28th, her factotum, the
bailiff, came with a message, requesting to know
whether I had overcome Mrs. ——’s scruples, and, if
not, desiring I would certify it in writing. Accordingly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
I wrote a letter, in which I justified my own
refusal to go to Damascus, on the ground that
Mrs. —— was totally new to the country; had no
soul to talk to; had, in compliance with Lady Hester’s
wishes, brought no maid-servant who could understand
her; and that I could not find it right to leave her,
much as I regretted the disappointment and vexation
that such a step caused her ladyship, and her friend
and mine, Ahmed Bey.</p>

<p>February 3, 1831.—I heard no more of Lady
Hester until this day, when the horse was sent, and,
on entering her saloon, a stormy altercation took place
between us, in the presence of her secretary. The
final result was, that I signified my wish, as soon as
I had done what I could for her, to take my family
back again to Europe, regretting I had come so far to
so little purpose. “I have given,” said she, “a good
deal of advice to many persons in whom I have taken
an interest, and you are the last of my disciples whom
I thought I could make something of: but it is like
cutting the hair off the legs of half-bred horses; it
grows again, and you may often get a kick in the face
for your pains. You know what a good opinion they
had of you in this country, which I kept up; but your
conduct now has spoiled all: for when a man gives his
beard to a woman it is all over with him. Remember
my words, and write them down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
But she was not to be so easily foiled. She returned
to the charge, and again urged me to undertake
the journey to Damascus. She called my attention
to the words of Ahmed Bey’s letter, describing Hassan
Effendi’s malady: “His chest is without pain, and
so is his throat, and the complaint seems to be in his
mouth.” These expressions she interpreted as a clear
indication that this great man was somebody who had
a communication to make to her, which was of too
much importance to be trusted to a letter, and that
that was what was meant by the “complaint in the
mouth.” Anxious, therefore, to know what this secret
business was, she thought neither of the state of the
weather (for the snow was lying deep on the upper
chain of Mount Lebanon, over which the road to
Damascus lay), nor of the complete loneliness in which
my family would be left. It is true that, in another
cottage in the village, Mr. Chasseaud and his wife lived,
and they had shown every disposition in their power
to enliven Mrs. ——’s solitude; but this was the rainy
season, and there were days when it was impossible to
get from house to house, owing to the violence of the
wind and the torrents of water that fell from the
heavens: and, when the rain abated, the mud, mixed
with dung of cattle, so completely filled the paths,
that it was impossible to walk five steps.</p>

<p>That there was cause for apprehension, when left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
alone, may be seen from what had occurred on the
24th of January. It rained heavily, and I was sitting
writing in the evening, when the black slave told me
that about two hundred soldiers had halted for the
night in the village, on their way to join Abdallah,
Pasha of Acre, who was besieging the castle of
Nablôos, where the inhabitants were in a state of insurrection,
brought on by the arbitrary exactions of
the local government. In those days, soldiers in villages
often committed many excesses. We had no
bolt to our front door, nor any fastening but a hook to
the window-shutters. About nine in the evening, the
following note was brought me by Mr. Chasseaud’s
servant:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="indent2">“Dear Dr. ——,</p>

<p class="indent5">“We have a great many troops this evening
in the village, and some of them very cut-throat-looking
fellows. I am well armed, and do not care for
them. You would not do wrong to be also on your
guard. </p>

<p class="center">“Yours truly,</p>

<p class="right r2">
“<span class="smcap">J. Chasseaud</span>.”
</p>
</div><!--end letter-->

<p>But I had no arms, excepting my fowling-piece,
which was nailed down in a case that I had not yet
had time to open; so, putting my reliance on the
respect which the name of Lady Hester Stanhope obtained
for those belonging to her establishment, and on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
the heavy rains, I wrote on, not altogether free from
alarm, when, sometimes, the blasts of wind shook the
door and window-shutters, and made me uncertain
whether the noise I heard was that of the elements or
of man.</p>

<p>A truce seemed now to have been concluded between
Lady Hester and ourselves, by a suspension of hostilities,
but it was only to mature a fresh attack.
Abdallah Pasha had been busied for some months in
making a European garden in the environs of Acre,
as a place of recreation for himself and his harým, and
Lady Hester had given him many useful instructions
in the laying of it out, and had from time to time
sent her Italian servant, Paolo Perini, to lend a
helping hand. The following day, therefore, was spent
in writing a letter about the building of a pavilion,
which was dictated in French, and then translated
into Arabic by her Arabian secretary, Khalyl Mansôor,
who, being a shopkeeper at Sayda, was sent for
whenever there were Arabic letters to write. Much
amusement arose about the construction of a phrase,
in which pillars of the Ionic order were named.
Mansôor hinted that the word Ionique had a signification
in Arabic which rendered it impossible to use it.
I had made a drawing of the five orders of architecture,
and what was to be written was an explanation of their
differences, so that a full hour was spent in getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
over the difficulty.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Then a letter was written to
Abd el Rahmàn Berber, a Turkish merchant, with a
remittance of five hundred dollars, due for interest on
money lent; and, as he was about setting off on his
pilgrimage to Mecca, the remittance was accompanied
with a supply of medicines and small stores for his
journey, such as tea, chocolate, syrups, &amp;c.</p>

<p>February 4.—This day was passed in writing letters
of advice and bills of exchange on London, and a letter
to the Emir Hyder, of Shumbalàn; also in arranging
Miss W.’s papers. In addressing the bills of exchange
to the house of Messrs. Coutts and Co., Lady
Hester’s recollections were carried back to that opulent
banker’s times. “One day,” said she, “on calling
on Mr. Coutts, the old man happened to be very gay,
and, on my entering his room, he addressed me
thus:—‘I consider myself one of the most enviable
of men: let me see—I have had the visit of one, two,
three, four, five, six, and you make the seventh,
of the handsomest women in London.’ The Miss
Gubbinses had just been there—they went out as I
entered; they were beautiful, doctor! On another
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
occasion, old Coutts put his hands on each side of
my face, and kissed me on the forehead, with an
exclamation of ‘Good God! how like my old friend,
your grandfather! You must forgive an old man, if
he can’t refrain from almost embracing you—it is
the exact sound of his voice. Ah!’ he continued, ‘I
think I see him now, seated in that chair; and, after
I had been explaining my views in politics, or on anything
else, cutting them all up at once by something
that was indisputable.’ That is, doctor, just as if a
person had been going on explaining their views respecting
a child, and another should say, ‘that’s all
useless—the child is dead.’ My grandfather dived
into futurity, as I do. Mr. Pitt, too, would often tell
me how much I was like Lord Chatham, my grandfather.
Sometimes, when I was speaking, he would
exclaim, ‘Good God! if I were to shut my eyes, I
should think it was my father! and, how odd! I
heard him say almost those very words forty years
ago.’ My grandfather, doctor,” said Lady Hester,
going on, “had gray eyes like mine, and yet, by
candlelight, from the expression that was in them, one
would have thought them black. When he was angry,
or speaking very much in earnest, nobody could look
him in the face. His memory on things even of a
common nature, and his observations, were striking.
On passing a place where he had been ten years before,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
he would observe, that there used to be a tree, or a
stone, or a something, that was gone, and on inquiry
it always proved to be so; yet he travelled always
with four horses, at a great rate.”</p>

<p>February 5.—The whole day was taken up in
making a drawing to explain the nature of a forcing-pump,
or engine, for watering the shrubs and flowers
in Abdallah Pasha’s garden.</p>

<p>February 6.—From one in the afternoon until ten
at night, not excepting the time we were at dinner,
Lady Hester Stanhope talked of the Damascus affair,
endeavouring to prove to me that my refusal would
endanger my life, and embroil the government of
Damascus with Mr. Farren, the new consul-general,
who was expected from England; showing that, in
her situation, where her consideration among the
natives depended entirely on opinion, Mrs. ——’s
opposition to her will, if not effectually put down,
would be subversive of all her authority, and make it
be supposed she was not the great personage she was
held to be; inasmuch as, among Eastern nations, in
all clans, communities, and separate governments,
there was, and ought to be, but one will, which was
that of the head. I admitted all this to be true; but
told her, there seemed to be no other way of settling
the affair than by our withdrawing at once to Europe.
She gave me to understand we might certainly go if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
we liked, but that we should find it more difficult than
I suspected. This was no idle threat of hers, and I
knew it; for not a peasant would dare to let out his
camels, mules, or asses, to one who was known to have
incurred her displeasure; and to send to Sayda to hire
them was equally impossible, seeing that no one would
go willingly on such an errand; or, if he did, her
influence extended far enough to frighten camel-drivers
and muleteers from their engagement. The close of
the conversation was a separation far from amicable;
so that on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of February, I did
not see her.</p>

<p>February 11, 1831.—My horse was sent over, and
I remained from noon until my dinner-time. All was
gentleness and urbanity. The conversation turned on
Mr. Pitt, her father, and her brothers; on Tom Paine,
Mr. Way, Mrs. Nash, and others. She seemed to be
disposed to resort to her customary tactics, which were
to make attacks at intervals, and then to wait a day
or two, to see if they had taken effect. I will relate
some of her anecdotes.</p>

<p>“Mr. Pitt loved ardently Lord A*******’s
daughter,”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> said Lady Hester Stanhope; “she was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
the only woman I could have wished him to marry.
I had never seen her; and, as she frequented Beckenham
church, I went on a visit to Mr. Grote’s, the
banker, to get a sight of her. I went to church with
Mr. Long’s brother, dean of somewhere, I forget now,
a monstrous handsome man. As soon as we appeared
in the pew, she knew who I was, and her whole body
became of one deep red. A paleness followed; she
drooped her head, put her hand to her face, and bent
over her book, as if praying. When the service was
over, I considered that the meeting with her was not
a scene fit for the church-porch, but I was resolved to
have a close look at her. As we approached her, she
pretended to be talking in an animated manner with
some of her party, but her attention was evidently
turned towards me. When we saluted, I saw she
was beautiful—very beautiful, doctor.</p>

<p>“Next day rat-tat-tat came a carriage and four to
Mr. Grote’s door. ‘My dear Mr. Grote, we have
long been neighbours, but I don’t know how it is, we
have not seen so much of each other as we ought to
have done.’ This was Lord A. and the mother. The
young lady was more collected by this time, and
the conversation went on very well. On the following
day, Mr. Grote and I called at Lord A.’s; but, the
porter not having received his instructions, we were
rudely sent away. The carriage had hardly got twenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
yards, when out came my lord, and a whole posse of
them, with a thousand apologies for the blunders of
servants; and we returned, and went in. She had
been walking out, drawing, or something; and when
she pushed up her bonnet, and turned her hair aside,
oh, doctor, what a forehead was there!</p>

<p>“Poor Mr. Pitt almost broke his heart when he
gave her up. But he considered that she was not a
woman to be left at will when business might require
it, and he sacrificed his feelings to his sense of public
duty. Yet Mr. Pitt was a man just made for domestic
life, who would have enjoyed retirement, digging
his own garden, and doing it cleverly too. But
it was God’s will it should be otherwise. I never
saw her afterwards but once, when she was Lady
B**************. Oh dear! how she was
changed! I remember, it was at Lady Chatham’s.
When I first knew her, she had a mouth no bigger
than an eye. Well! on entering the room at Lady
Chatham’s where she was, some years after her marriage,
I recognized her no more than if I had never
seen her. She saw it, and began speaking of persons
with whom I was acquainted. This made me think
the more who she could be; when, observing my embarrassment,
she said, ‘I see, Lady Hester, you have
forgotten me.’ Well, doctor, her mouth was grown
quite large and ugly, and I have observed that it does,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
as people grow older;—I don’t know why: but look
at mine, and you’ll see just the same thing.</p>

<p>“‘There were also other reasons,’ Mr. Pitt would
say; ‘there is her mother, such a chatterer!—and
then the family intrigues. I can’t keep them out of
my house; and, for my king’s and country’s sake,
I must remain a single man.’”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Lady Hester said it was fine fun to see these
match-making mothers bring their daughters down to
Walmer to try to get Mr. P. into a scrape, and the
extraordinary distance at which he contrived to keep
them. Sometimes, if they approached him, or wanted
to plant their daughters too near him, it was the fire
was too warm, or the air from the window, or some
excuse for removing his chair to a distance from them.</p>

<p>I observed, “it was not to be supposed that a man,
buried in state affairs, could give a thought to the
tender passion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
“I beg your pardon,” she replied; “I have heard
him talk in raptures of some women. He used to
say, he considered no man ought to marry who could
not give a proper share of his time to his wife; for,
how would it be if he was always at the House, or in
business, and she always at the opera, or whirling
about in her carriage?”</p>

<p>“People thought Mr. Pitt did not care about
women, and knew nothing about them; but they
were very much mistaken. Mrs. B——s, of Devonshire,
when she was Miss W——, was so pretty, that
Mr. Pitt drank out of her shoe. Nobody understood
shape, and beauty, and dress, better than he did; with
a glance of his eye he saw it all at once. But the
world was ignorant of much respecting him. Who
ever thought that there was not a better judge of
women in London than he? and not only of women
as they present themselves to the eye, but that his
knowledge was so critical that he could analyze their
features and persons in a most masterly way. Not a
defect, not a blemish, escaped him: he would detect
a shoulder too high, a limp in the gait, where nobody
else would have seen it; and his beauties were real,
natural, beauties. In dress, too, his taste was equally
refined. I never shall forget, when I had arranged
the folds and drapery of a beautiful dress which I
wore one evening, how he said to me, ‘Really, Hester,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
you are bent on conquest to-night: but would it be
too bold in me, if I were to suggest that that particular
fold’—and he pointed to a triangular fall which
I had given to one part—‘were looped up so?’ and,
would you believe it?—it was exactly what was wanting
to complete the classical form of my dress. He was so
in everything.</p>

<p>“Mr. Pitt used to say, when I went out in my
habit and a sort of furred jacket, that women, when
they rode out, generally looked such figures; but
that I contrived to make a very handsome costume
of it.</p>

<p>“He had so much urbanity, too! I recollect returning
late from a ball, when he was gone to bed
fatigued: there were others besides myself, and we
made a good deal of noise. I said to him next morning,
‘I am afraid we disturbed you last night.’ ‘Not at
all,’ he replied; ‘I was dreaming of the Mask of
Comus, Hester, and, when I heard you all so gay, it
seemed a pleasant reality.’</p>

<p>“To show you what an excellent heart Mr. Pitt
had, and how full of sympathy he was for people whom
others spurned, I’ll tell you what happened one day,
when we were at Walmer. I said to him, ‘Who do
you think is coming down to dinner to-night?’ ‘I
don’t know, Hester: tell me.’ ‘Why,’ said I,
‘H**** D*****’s mistress:—oh! but I’ll pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
soon look her out of countenance.’ I was only in
joke, doctor. H. D., who was by the same mother as
Lord D., but born before the mother was married, had
for his mistress a very excellent woman, whose meritorious
conduct every body spoke of: so I thought I
would have a little fun about her, and told Mr. Pitt
that H. D. was going to bring her with him. ‘My
dear Hester,’ cried Mr. Pitt, ‘for God’s sake, don’t
distress the poor woman, if she is coming—now, pray,
don’t!’ ‘Oh! yes, I will, I will,’ I replied. ‘Now,
I entreat you,’ said Mr. Pitt. ‘Here she comes,’
cried I; and a post-chaise drove past us, near the
drawbridge. Mr. Pitt turned his head towards me as
it passed, pretending to be talking to me, ‘She is
very pretty,’ said I. ‘Well,’ said Mr. Pitt, ‘I must
go and give some orders about her room;’ and he was
actually going to put her in the best room in the
house, and to desire some other persons who were
expected to be sent to the village, when I told him it
was all a joke; for it was only H. D.’s post-chaise,
with his man in it, come down before his master.”</p>

<p>Here Lady Hester Stanhope paused for a little time,
as if musing; and, at length, led away by her reflections,
when she resumed the conversation, she uttered
certain sentiments, which, however startling in comparison
with the mere conventional morality of society,
I am emboldened to transcribe. “Doctor,” she said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
in an <a id="chg4"></a>impressive tone, “I saw in the newspapers an
account of a poor creature found on the step of a door
in some street in Westminster. She was named the
Fair Ellen—a wretched outcast from society—and
was in the last stage of starvation. A poor forlorn
woman, like herself, found her there, took her home,
sold her petticoat to relieve her, and, probably from
her over-anxiety to give her something good for her
weak stomach, fed her more than she was able to bear,
and the Fair Ellen died. Now, doctor, let the friend
of the fair Ellen come to me, and I will receive her to
my bosom, and she shall be my friend; for such sentiments
as hers will I honour and respect wherever I
find them.” She went on: “How strange it is that
immorality, in England, is met in some persons by
such severity—much too great; and, in others,
escapes animadversion! * &emsp; * &emsp; * &emsp; * &emsp; *
The poor are spurned for errors not half so gross as
what the wealthy my lords do in the open face of day,
and set people at defiance to boot.”</p>

<p>She went on: “To get inmates for brothels, and
mistresses for the rich, fancy a procuress to some
great my lord, who sets off for Wales, or for some
distant province of England. Down she goes, accompanied
by a sort of confidential servant, whom she
affects to retain from the great attachment that her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
poor dear husband had for him; and she places herself
in handsome lodgings in a town, or in some pretty
cottage in a village. There she visits the poor and
the sick, or does some act of charity to make herself
talked about, and, in the mean time, looks out for
some handsome girl. When she has found one that
she thinks will suit her purpose, she first takes her as
her maid, treats her with great kindness, and, when
the girl has conceived a liking for her, she all of a
sudden pretends she has received news from London
of the death of a brother, or the sickness of a dear
friend, and says she must set off directly. The poor
girl, whom she has fed with hopes of what she may
become some day, by telling her that she has no relations
that she cares for and perhaps may leave her
something when she dies, desires to be taken with
her; and the procuress, with a show of generous
feeling for her, says she will not let her go, unless she
can ensure her bettering herself, and begs that her
parents will have a paper drawn up, that she is to
remain five or seven years with her, or else she, the
lady, is to give her fifty pounds. The parents, delighted
with the disinterested offer of their child’s
mistress, get the agreement legally drawn up, sign it,
and sign their daughter’s ruin.</p>

<p>“As soon as they are in London, dress, pleasure,
and other allurements, are offered her. She forgets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
her humble home, and becomes the dupe of her artful
seducer. If any inquiry is made after her, perhaps
the fifty pounds are paid; and the very agreement
that was to secure her safety becomes the bond of
her destruction.</p>

<p>“Lady Hamilton was brought from Wales in this
manner, a fine, rosy-faced, and rather blowsy country
girl. A set of virtuosoes wanted a model for a Venus,
and some of them, who knew Lady H., fixed on her;
but Sir W. H. took her out of their hands, and
carried her to Naples. Yet how did she end?—with
not money enough to bury her; and so did
Mrs. Jordan.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>February 12 to 18.—It rained so hard, that, for a
week, we were almost confined to the house. Our
good friends, Mr. and Mrs. Chasseaud, when it was
possible, either came and passed the evening with us,
or we went to their cottage. On awaking, on the
morning of the 16th, we found the bed-room and the
counterpane of our bed wet with the rain, which had
penetrated the roof in every part, excepting, luckily,
over the children’s bed. The bedding and carpets
were obliged to be removed into another room. The
day proved very stormy; and, for two or three days
more, we were compelled to live and sleep in the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
room, being the only one that was waterproof. The
occasional squalls were so violent, that a gust of wind
would whirl a large copper ewer to the distance of a
yard. All the trelliscourt of our terrace was blown
away, like chaff before the whirlwind.</p>

<p>February 21.—Nine hours were spent to-day in
conversation with Lady Hester, from three in the
afternoon until midnight. She spoke of Lord Stewart
de Rothsay, of the Duke of Sussex, of Mr. Pitt, and
many other persons. The weather was beautiful; and,
although the sides of Mount Lebanon, only a few
miles off, were covered with snow, we sat until sunset
with the windows open. The climate of Syria is, probably,
one of the most pure and balmy in the world.</p>

<p>Lady Hester, from one thing to another, returned
to the subject of Mr. Pitt’s amiable disposition. “It
is wonderful,” said she, “what a man Mr. Pitt was.
Nobody would have suspected how much feeling he had
for people’s comforts, who came to see him. Sometimes
he would say to me, ‘Hester, you know we have
got such a one coming down. I believe his wound is
hardly well yet, and I heard him say, that he felt
much relieved by fomentations of such an herb: perhaps
you will see that he finds in his chamber all that
he wants.’ Of another, he would say—‘I think he
drinks ass’s milk; I should like him to have his
morning’s draught.’ And I, who was born with such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
sensibility, that I must fidget myself about everybody,
no matter whom, was always sure to exceed his
wishes.</p>

<p>“Would you believe, doctor, that, in the last weeks
of his last illness, he found time to think about his
groom, in a way that nobody would have suspected in
him? He had four grooms, who died of consumption,
from being obliged to ride so hard after him; for they
drank and caught cold, and so ruined their constitutions.
This one I am speaking of, when first attacked
in the lungs, was placed at Knightsbridge, and then
sent to the seaside. One day, Mr. Pitt, speaking of
him, said to me—‘The poor fellow, I am afraid, is
very bad: I have been thinking of a way to give him
a little consolation. I suspect he is in love with
Mary, the housemaid; for, one morning, early, I found
them talking closely together, and she was covered with
blushes. Couldn’t you contrive, without hurting his
feelings, to get her to attend on him in his illness?’</p>

<p>“Accordingly, soon after, when he was about to set
off for Hastings, I went to see him. ‘Have you nobody,’
I asked him, ‘whom you would like to go to
the sea-side with you?—your sister or your mother?’
‘No, thank you, lady.’ ‘There is the still-room
maid, would you like her?’ ‘Ah, my lady, she has a
great deal to do, and is always wanted.’ From one
to another, I, at last, mentioned Mary, and I saw I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
had hit on the right person; but, however, he only
observed, he should like to see her before he went.
Mary was, therefore, sent to him; and the result of
their conversation was, that he told her he would
marry her if he recovered, or leave her all he had if
he died—which he did.</p>

<p>“Mr. Pitt once obtained a servant in a very odd
way. Riding on the moors with a friend, they came
to one of those flocks of geese, which, picked of their
feathers, are driven about by a boy, with a bit of red
rag at the end of a long stick. ‘We must ride round,’
said Mr. Pitt; ‘we shall never get through this
immense flock.’ ‘Yes, but you may,’ cried a sharp-looking
boy, who had heard him, ‘if you will only
keep your horses quiet. Sh—sh—ee—ee—ayi—ayi!’
and the boy waved his stick here and there, and in a
minute or two the flock opened, and, wheeling to the
left and right in regular columns, made a passage,
through which they rode. ‘That must be a clever
lad,’ observed Mr. Pitt; ‘he manœuvres his little
army in a wonderful manner—a general could not do it
better;’ and he ordered the groom to inquire to whom he
belonged. A day or two afterwards he was sent for, and
put into the stables. Next, he was made an undergroom;
then taken to town to wait on the upper
servants, and afterwards made a footman; until, one
day, Mr. Pitt, going down to Hollwood with Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
Dundas, and three or four friends, to talk about some
parliamentary business (a custom he had, when he
wanted to discuss any particular plan in quiet), lo and
behold! the cook fell down in an apoplectic fit, and
died; and the butler, who saw it, was so affected that
he was seized with a fit of the gout. This butler was
also Mr. Pitt’s valet, on such occasions as when he was
out of town for a day. Mr. Pitt was in a sad fidget
about the dinner: but the young man in question
said, ‘Don’t, sir, send off any express for a cook: if
you think proper, the maid shall dress the dinner.
These are all your intimate friends, and will take no
notice: their servants as yet know nothing of the
matter; for I thought they might be frightened to be
where there is a dead man. Let me manage, and all
will go well, without any alarm being spread.’ He,
accordingly, dressed Mr. Pitt, saw to everything, and
acquitted himself so well, that Mr. Pitt was more than
satisfied with him, and soon afterwards made him his
valet; but he did not live long enough to have his services
recompensed. He died quite young, at twenty-seven.
He was a man all fire and activity. Mr. Pitt would
say to him, ‘You must go down to-day to such a
place, and I shall be there the day after to-morrow.’
‘You will excuse me, sir,’ the man would reply, ‘but
I sha’n’t go; for, if I do, who will attend to you when
you take your physic to-morrow? You will be busy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
and put it off; and nobody knows how to give it but
myself.’ ‘Well, well,’ Mr. Pitt would answer, ‘do so
then;’ and would excuse him by an—‘Ah! he is very
anxious about me—I must let him have his own
way.’”</p>

<p>It was a remarkable proof of Lady Hester Stanhope’s
memory, that, whatever subject she stumbled
on, she had an inexhaustible fund of anecdotes ready;
and, having got into the servants’ hall, she seemed as
much at home there as in the drawing-room. She
told me a pathetic history of a faithful servant, who,
in the pecuniary distresses of his master, served him
for several years with the purest disinterestedness. I
was so touched by her eloquent and forcible manner
of relating the story, and with the self-application
that I made of it to my own tardiness in going to her
in her distress, together with my present intention of
leaving her, owing to our recent differences, that I
burst into tears, and wept, as the expression is, bitterly.
She soothed my feelings, endeavoured to calm my
emotions, and disclaimed all intention of conveying
any allusion to me. This led her to say, how little
malice she ever entertained against any one, even towards
those who had done her injury, much less against
me, who had always shown my attachment to her:
and she said that, even now, although she was going
to lose me, still her thoughts did not run on her own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
situation so much as on what would become of me:
and I firmly believed her.</p>

<p>February 23 to 26, 1831.—Another fresh trouble
now harassed Lady Hester. Paolo, her Italian
servant, who had been sent to Acre to assist in laying
out the Pasha’s garden, made or received offers there
to fill a good post in the Artillery, he having served
as a soldier during Buonaparte’s campaigns. He,
therefore, came back to her ladyship’s, to signify his
intention of leaving his place, hoping she would, in
consideration of his services, give him a character to
the Pasha. There had been some shuffling in the
business on Paolo’s part, so Lady Hester was determined
to play him a trick, as he had tricked her.
Instead, therefore, of a written good character, she put
a blank sheet, undercover, to the Pasha; and, causing
it to be directed with the customary titles and superscription
to his highness, she gave it to Paolo, paid him
his wages, and sent him off, exulting in the prospect
of the lucrative post he was about to be promoted to.
When he had obtained admittance to the Pasha, he
presented his letter, and, the seal being broken, a
blank sheet was all that the cover contained. Another
letter to the Pasha, explaining what had been done,
had been despatched by a special messenger, in which
Lady Hester Stanhope showed Paolo’s unfitness for a
gunner, and urged him not to expose his men to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
chance of being blown to pieces at the cannon’s mouth
by the ignorance of a man who would make a decent
valet, but a very bad artilleryman. The Pasha took
the hint, and sent Paolo about his business, who
hastened back to Beyrout, and retreated, crestfallen,
to Europe.</p>

<p>Nothing farther was said about the Damascus affair.
A long letter, on the organization of a body of regular
troops, was drawn up, and sent to Abdallah Pasha.
This, with the trouble of translating it into Arabic,
occupied three or four days. Letters were written to
Dr. Dusap, of Cairo, relative to the purchase of some
black slaves, to Lord Ebrington, and to some other
persons, which filled up the time until March 7.
The intervals of writing were devoted to conversations
on the coming of the Murdah, or new Messiah, and
Lady Hester laboured hard to make me a convert to
her doctrines. She expressed her regret that the
result of the fulfilment of her predictions would be for
strangers, and not for her friends.</p>

“That was the reason that Mr. Pitt would not marry his
daughter. She was unlike all the other sisters. The mother,
like a hen with her chickens, would sit sometimes at a party,
and almost devour a peer, to see if she could get him for one

<p class="p2">As many travellers have circulated the report that
Lady Hester Stanhope had announced the coming of a
Messiah, and that she had shown her two Arabian
mares, as of a particular breed, which were never to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
be mounted until this second advent, making inferences
therefrom little favourable to that lady’s sanity, it
may not be amiss to state, in her own words, what
she actually did say on this subject.</p>

<p>“All sects,” said her ladyship, “have predicted
the coming of a Saviour or Messiah; this event, it is
foretold, will be preceded by the overthrow of most of
the kingdoms of Christendom: the work has already
begun, and we may soon expect its completion. For
is not the world in a state of revolution? Have not
kings been driven from their thrones? Hundreds and
thousands of distressed persons will come to me for
assistance and refuge. I shall have to wade up to
here” (pointing to her girdle) “in blood; but it is
the will of God, and I shall not be afraid. The advent
of the Murdah has occupied the minds of many people,
and I think unsuccessfully. M. Lamartine talked
about religion to me. I told him—‘Does not the
Testament say, ‘But there is one shall come after me,
who is greater than I am—who is that?’ He hummed
and hahed, but could make no reply.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Is he not to
appear as an earthly king, in honour and glory? The
Jews expect him, the Turks expect him, the Ansarias
expect him; all expect him but the Christians. What
did Lord P********** shoot himself for, but from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
the impossibility of getting at the truth in this matter?
And the great Duke de St. Simon, how did he puzzle
his brain to no purpose! He knew a great deal—much
more than Enfantin and all his followers. Enfantin
got hold of his manuscripts, and Rodrigo, his secretary,
copied them; but they could not make it out.
The St. Simonians came to see me; they thought to
get hold of me, but they were mistaken. I know the
woman that will suit them; a great <i>bint el hawa</i>, a
beautiful creature.</p>

<p>“You tell me of secret societies, which have risen
up in Europe since the long war. Did not I know all
that? I have been bred in the work of revolutions
since I was first with Mr. Pitt. How many plots did
he crush, within two or three days of their consummation,
of which not a syllable was ever known! The
great freemasons, doctor, exist all over the world: they
know I am the person they want. Many of them
have been sent as spies on my actions; but I shall
stand in no need of them—it is they who will want
me. When the course of events shall have brought
things to a point, I shall have assistance enough.
All the people who come here after me, are sent to
say something: Lord B******, who saw me at
Tiberias, was a freemason, and one of them.”</p>

<p>It is pretty plain, from all this, that Lady Hester
Stanhope had a persuasion of the coming of a new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
Messiah: but whether she entertained it as a matter
of spiritual faith, or as the groundwork of some great
scheme she was bringing to bear, others must decide.
Sometimes, one was almost forced to conclude that
the constant workings of her brain had impaired it.
Add to this, the feverish greediness with which she
received all reports of insurrections, revolts, and
political changes. Even her servants knew her weakness
on these points; and there was not a fellow in
her establishment who did not return home every
night with some cock and bull story, to feed her
diseased imagination; and it was an every-day piece
of flattery to say that they had heard that all the
power of the Sultan and his Pashas was nothing now,
but that the Syt’s protection alone was worth having.
Still let it not be supposed that, on any other subject,
her faculties were in the least impaired. On every
concern of human life, on all other matters, whether
common or abstruse, she conversed like an oracle.
But she had talked so often of the coming of a Murdah<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
into the world, to chastise the wicked, subdue Christendom
and the Moslem countries, and remodel the face
of the globe, that even her maids were inclined to believe
it, or pretended to do so. Fatôom, the least of
them, if praised by her mistress, would ask whether,
when the Murdah came, she thought such an humble
being as herself might be saved? Whether this was
cunning or simplicity, may be doubted; but, from the
subsequent misconduct of this girl, in robbing her
ladyship, it was most likely the former. Lady Hester,
however, encouraged the belief of her future greatness,
and would often hold it out as a present temptation
for good behaviour to her servants.</p>

<p>Almost all such travellers as came to see her, and
who have in their published books spoken of her, mention
the two favourite mares, which she kept in expectation
of the coming of the Mahedi, and which she
never suffered any person to mount. They were
called Läila and Lulu. Läila was exceedingly hollow-backed,
being born saddled, as Lady Hester used to
say, and with a double backbone: she was a chestnut,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
and Lulu a gray. They were both thoroughbred:
they had each a groom, and were taken the greatest
care of. The green plat of ground on the east side of
the house-wall was set apart entirely for exercising
them twice a-day; and round this the grooms, with
<i lang="fr">longes</i>, were made to run them until they were well
warmed. This spot was sacred; and, whilst they
were at exercise, nobody, neither servant nor villager,
was allowed to cross it, or to stand still to look at
them, under the penalty of being dismissed her service.
Such an order, from its nature, would necessarily
be violated very often, but unknown to Lady
Hester; for, as she never went out of her house,
and could not overlook that side of it, a tacit understanding
among the people made them true to their
own secrets: but, from time to time, accident, or the
unguarded disclosures of some of the maids, made her
aware that her orders had been slighted, and then her
anger exceeded all bounds. Few were the travellers
who were admitted to these mares in their stable;
and never was the permission granted, until it had
been ascertained that their star would not be baneful
to them.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Horses in Syria, for about seven months in the
year, are tethered out of doors, where they are fed and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
littered down. It was under a shed, covered with
thatch, shut in at the two sides by a treillage, with
three parterres of flowers and shrubs behind them,
that these two beautiful animals stood. Every morning,
in the summer, the grooms washed their tails, legs,
and manes, in soap and water, and watered the ground
beneath their feet, to keep them cool; but, during the
winter months, they were stalled in their stables, and
warm felts covered their delicate limbs. Apis, in his
most glorious days, and surrounded by his priesthood,
could not have been better attended to.</p>

<p>Lady Hester Stanhope one day assured me that,
when her pecuniary difficulties pressed hardest upon
her, had it not been for the sake of those two creatures,
she should have given up her house and everything
to her creditors, sold her pension to pay them, and
quitted the country: but she resolved to wait for the
consummation of events on their account. “Ah,
doctor,” added she, “I recollect, when I was at Rome,
seeing, in a beautiful bas-relief, that very mare, with
her hollow back made like a saddle. Two Englishmen
were standing by, and were criticising the very
same thing that caught my attention. ‘How very
beautiful,’ said one, ‘is that basso-relievo! but the
ancients, somehow, never could set about a good thing
without spoiling it. There is that hollow-backed
horse—did you ever see such a thing?’ I heard it all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
but I made my own observations; and now, you see,
I have got a mare of the very same breed.”</p>

<p>There is reason to think, from what her ladyship
let fall at different times, that Brothers, the fortune-teller,
in England, and one Metta, a village doctor, on
Mount Lebanon, had considerable influence on her
actions, and, perhaps, her destiny. When Brothers
was taken up, and thrown into prison (in Mr. Pitt’s
time), he told those who arrested him to do the will of
Heaven, but first to let him see Lady Hester Stanhope.
This was repeated to her ladyship, and curiosity induced
her to comply with the man’s request. Brothers
told her that “she would one day go to Jerusalem,
and lead back the chosen people; that, on her arrival
in the Holy Land, mighty changes would take place
in the world, and that she would pass seven years in
the desert.” Trivial circumstances will foster a foolish
belief in a mind disposed to encourage it. Mr. Frederick
North, afterwards Lord Guildford, in the course
of his travels, came to Brusa, whither Lady Hester had
gone for the benefit of the hot baths. He, Mr. Fazakerly,
and Mr. Gally Knight, would often banter
her on her future greatness among the Jews. “Well,
madam, you must go to Jerusalem. Hester, queen of
the Jews! Hester, queen of the Jews!” was echoed
from one to the other; and probably, at last, the coincidence
of a name, a prophecy, and the country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
towards which she found herself going, were thought,
even by herself, to be something extraordinary.
Metta took up the book of fate from that time, and
showed her the part she was to play in the East.
This man, Metta, for some years subsequent to 1815,
was in her service as a kind of steward. He was
advanced in years; and, like the rest of the Syrians,
believed in astrology, spirits, and prophecy. No
doubt, he perceived in Lady Hester Stanhope a tincture
of the same belief: and, on some occasion, in
conversation, he said he knew of a book on prophecy,
which he thought had passages in it that related to
her. This book, he persuaded her, could only be had
by a fortunate conjunction connected with himself;
and he said, if she would only lend him a good horse,
to take him to the place where it was, he would procure
her a sight of it, but she was never to ask where
he fetched it from. All this exactly suited Lady
Hester’s love of mystery. A horse was granted him;
he went off, and returned with the prophetic volume,
which he said he could keep only a certain number of
hours. It was written in Arabic, and he was to read
and explain the text. The part which he expounded
was—“That a European female would come and live
on Mount Lebanon at a certain epoch, would build a
house there, and would obtain power and influence
greater than a Sultan’s; that a boy, without a father,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
would join her, whose destiny would be fulfilled under
her wing; that the coming of the Mahedi would
follow, but be preceded by war, pestilence, famine, and
other calamities; that the Mahedi would ride a horse
born saddled, and that a woman would come from a
far country<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> to partake in the mission.” There were
many other incidents besides which were told, but
which I did not recollect.</p>

<p>Certain it is, that Lady Hester Stanhope had, for a
long time, a persuasion that the Duke of Reichstadt
would some day visit her, and she imagined he was
the boy pointed out in the prophecy. After his death,
she fixed on another, who is alluded to in one of her
letters to me.</p>

<p>Metta died, leaving three sons; and, on his death-bed,
in the presence of his wife and children, said
to them, “You will tell the Syt, my lady, that I
bequeath you, my children, to her. I have no friend
in the world but her: you are poor, and she will
provide for you.” The reader will, no doubt, call to
mind the dying legacy of the poor Grecian philosopher,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
who bequeathed his penniless daughter to his
friend, and desired he would marry her. This appeal
is understood in the East. Metta had made his
calculations with subtilty, for Lady Hester Stanhope
never deserted the orphans; and, although one proved
a sot, she bore with his idleness and dissipation, and
brought them all three forward in the world.</p>

<p>When Lady Hester Stanhope recounted this story
to me, I had not the least doubt left in my mind of
her conviction that all these things would be fulfilled.
“You,” she said, “are of such a cold disposition,
that nothing one can say makes any impression on
you. I had thought, from your letters, that you
liked this country, and that, seeing the dreadful
events which will shortly take place in Europe, you
wished to secure a safe retreat with me, and felt the
impulse of the doctrines I had so often talked to you
about. I let people here believe (as they had got
such an idea into their heads) that you had been sent
by my family to arrange my affairs. In doing this,
I had no view to my own interest. When the time
comes, thousands like you will be ready to serve me;
and, indeed, I should have no leisure then to talk to
you, occupied, as I shall be, in fulfilling my master’s
orders. All I thought was, that, if I could be of any
use to you in procuring you a safe asylum, I should
have done my duty by you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
Quitting this subject, Lady Hester Stanhope related
some anecdotes of the royal dukes, of Lady
Augusta Murray, Mrs. Jordan, Mrs. Nugent, &amp;c.
This led her to speak of the influence women exercise
over the actions of men, and of the power they secretly
exert in affairs where the ostensible actors are
grave statesmen. She told me that the Turkish
women, veiled and shut up in harýms, were not less
the springs of action in Mahometan countries, than
European women are, flouncing about in saloons.
Nor were they a bit less self-willed, even down to purchased
slaves, who are generally supposed to be mere
mechanical beings, all submission to their master’s
will. She related a story, in proof of her assertion,
the substance of which was <span class="lock">this:—</span></p>

<p>There was a Circassian, who had been in the Sultan’s
seraglio, but, for some cause, was sold, and fell into the
hands of the Dey of Algiers. When he went to see
her, in his own harým, and approached her to use such
familiarities as he thought himself entitled to, she
slapped his face, nor would she ever moderate her
open aversion to him. At last, he was obliged to resell
her. The would-be purchaser was a gentleman
(the narrator of these facts to Lady Hester Stanhope),
who, on going towards her, as she sat on a sofa, was
so electrified at the sight of her beauty as to lose the
power of utterance for some moments. His emotion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
pleased her; she liked him. He bought her; and
they lived long and happily together. Afterwards,
chance took her back again to Constantinople, and she
entered the seraglio a second time, being sold by the
man she had liked, who married another woman, and,
for prudential reasons, was obliged to part with her.
She rose to great wealth and power, but she never
forgot him; and her interest was always at his service
for himself and those he recommended.</p>

<p>On returning to my own cottage in the village,
(which was generally after midnight), I was accompanied
by a servant, who carried a lantern. On these
occasions, I rode an ass, as being the most sure-footed
creature for mountainous paths in the dark. In
England we have no idea of a road to a person’s
house such as this was; in itself, however, in no wise
different from that which led to the Emir Beshýr’s
palace, or to any other principal or princely dwelling
on Mount Lebanon. These paths are no wider than
is requisite for a mule or a horse; and, where the
sides of the mountains are unusually steep, they always
run in zigzags, and sometimes in steps. A slip, in
such places, might be attended with very serious consequences,
especially as in no case is there any protection
afforded by means of a parapet-wall or other
defence. It is not without very natural apprehension,
therefore, that a stranger to the country trusts himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
for the first time, even in the daylight, upon
these difficult mountain paths; and there were two
instances of Frenchmen, who were actually on their
way from Sayda to Lady Hester’s residence, when
they turned back in alarm from the apparent impracticability
of the road. But habit soon begets
indifference to obstacles of this kind, and the animals
of the country are so sagacious and sure-footed,
that anybody, who trusts to their skill rather than
his own, may traverse all such dangerous ways in
perfect safety.</p>

<p>I was about to say that, in going home at night,
three or four mastiffs, which lay in the courtyard,
commonly came out of the gate with me. Their
delight was to scour the distance between the house
and the village in search of jackals, wolves, and a
species of panther, found during the winter in the low
parts, but more commonly in the forests of the higher
chain of Mount Lebanon. In these nocturnal courses
I often heard the jackals, but had hitherto only encountered
one wolf; on one occasion, however, at
about two after midnight, on my way home, the dogs
set up a sharp bark, and, from a shelving terrace of
the rock above my head, a wolf made a desperate leap
across the path down the declivity, with the dogs at
his heels, and, like dark shadows, swift as lightning
they disappeared. I heard their rush for about ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
or fifteen seconds, and then, in about as many minutes
more, the dogs returned panting; but I was not able,
in the obscurity of the night, to see by their jaws
whether they had overtaken the wolf or not. Wild
boars are found in these mountains, as also foxes,
antelopes, and forest animals.</p>

<p>The following day, I walked out with my family
into a deep valley, between two lofty mountains,
wooded with low ilexes, locust-trees, oaks, arbutuses,
&amp;c. There was a goatherd leading a herd of goats;
and, just as we reached them, we saw a large mastiff
go down the side of the ravine in chase of some animal.
The goatherd told me it was a panther, which he
had roused in throwing a stone at one of his goats.
The dog, after a pursuit of some hundred yards, came
back. The man added, that these panthers were not
dangerous in the daytime, but might be after dark, if
very hard pressed for food. He and his companion,
however, seemed very indifferent about it, as if accustomed
to see them often. These goatherds remain,
during the whole of the winter season, on some particular
range of the lower mountains, and fold their
herds by night in caverns in the rocks, of which
there are many natural ones. Dogs, and a hedge of
prickly brambles, form their protection. In the
summer, they go back to their villages higher up.
Those we met came from a village called Muzrat es<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
Shoof, about three or four leagues off, and near the
snow.</p>

<p>March 9.—We went to Dayr Mkhallas, to revisit
Miss Williams’s tomb. I was entreated the same
day, by a peasant woman, to go to her husband, who
was lying ill of a malignant fever. He was then in
the agonies of death, and died the same evening; but
I had occasion to remark that he had six fingers on
each hand. I was told this day, also, of the mode of
curing sore throat as practised in the village. A handkerchief
was drawn tightly round the neck, until the
patient was half strangled, and this effected such a
revolution in the circulation, that the inflammation
subsided in a few hours. I had the information from
the mouth of a respectable man who had recently been
operated upon.</p>

<p>March 10 and 11 were spent with Lady Hester, who
was at one time in a state of high irritation against
her blacks, and, at another, busy as a housekeeper in
directing the package of three cases of dried fruits,
honey, syrups, <i>snobars</i>, or fir-apple pips, preserved
apricots, and other delicacies, intended for Dr. Dusap,
in Egypt.</p>

<p>March 11.—In the midst of her package she related
the following anecdote to me; it happened at Malta,
and I recollected the day very well. Her ladyship
had said to me, “On such a day I am going to dine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
at Lord Bute’s; he has not invited you, and it will
be a very good opportunity for you to see the medical
and other acquaintances you may have made here:
so invite whom you like to dinner, and I will give
orders to François about it. You will lose nothing
by not going to Lord B.’s; for he is a proud man, and
expects that doctors and tutors should never speak
but when spoken to. Mr. K. hardly opens his mouth
in his presence, except when my lord asks him a question,
or refers to him about a passage in Virgil, or
some book or another: but then how easily is a
clergyman, who has lived with great people, to be
known, and what superior manners he has! Always
possessing himself, and always unassuming, he is sure
to be well received everywhere.”</p>

<p>“I was dining,” said Lady Hester, “at Lord B.’s
on that occasion, and at dinner Lord B. asked me
what I thought of D*******, the banker’s son.
‘Oh!’ cried I, ‘I think of him as I do of all bankers’
sons I see skipping about the continent, that they had
much better be behind the counter; for, if they are
intended to follow their father’s trade, this skipping
about only unfits them for it, and they never after can
be brought to sit in some dark room, in a narrow
street in the city; and, if they are intended to be fine
gentlemen, it is ten to one but they ruin themselves:
or, if they do not, that their house gets a bad name:—am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
I not right, my lord?’ ‘Why, you know, Lady,
Hester,’ answered Lord B., ‘I generally agree with
you, but on this point I am not quite sure. Then
you don’t like bankers, Lady Hester?’ ‘Not particularly,
my lord,’ said I; but, as I looked up, I saw
Lord Ebrington screwing up his mouth, and Lady
B. looking very odd, whilst Lord B. looked very
cunning; the butler, all the while, standing first on
one leg and then the other, in a state of the strangest
uneasiness. All of a sudden old C***** came into
my head, and I saw what a blunder I had made.</p>

<p>“In going out of the room, Lady B. said, ‘Lady
Hester, you are always wild as you have been, but I
know you never mean any harm in what you say.’
And here the matter ended, as I thought. Lady B.,
however, did not forget it, as you shall hear. I kept
up a correspondence with her for fifteen or twenty
years, and her letters were full of protestations of service.
In 1827 I found myself at one time, as I have
already told you, very short of money, and I wrote
to Lady B. to ask her to lend me three hundred
pounds: the answer was, that she had not so much
at her disposal, without inconveniencing herself. After
this I never wrote to her again; but I had a great
mind to send her a letter to say, I did not think the
proud Lord B. would have left his widow so poor as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
to make three hundred pounds an object to her, when
I recollected to have seen as much given away to an
old butler or a poor housekeeper.”</p>

<p>March 12.—Lady Hester related another story.
“Mr. A******** wanted to be made—would you believe
it, doctor?—wanted to be made Lord Raleigh,
and I was determined he should not, if I could help
it. One morning, Mr. Pitt came into the drawing-room
to speak to me, so I said to him, ‘What a
pretty caricature they have made about A.;’ and I
described, as if I had seen it, a caricature in which
figured Queen Elizabeth and Mr. A. and the king;
and, with as much humour as I could, made such a
ridiculous picture that Mr. Pitt was quite amused.
Just as I had finished my description, somebody came
in, and interrupted the conversation; and, Mr. Pitt
going out to dinner, I saw no more of him. He,
thinking what I told him was a fact, repeated the
story to Mr. A. and others. Immediately half-a-dozen
people were despatched to all the caricature shops to
buy up the whole impression at any price; but, as the
whole was my invention, of course they found none:
for I had intended to say, ‘Fancy how ridiculous a
business it will appear, if such a caricature is published,
which is very likely.’ So, when I saw Mr.
Pitt next day, I told him; but the fright they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
been thrown into was so great that another title was
chosen. Subsequently, Mr. Pitt never would speak
to Lord S.</p>

<p>“The rise of Mr. A.’s father in the world was this.
Lord Chatham’s first coachman being taken ill, the
postillion was sent to the town for the family doctor;
but, not finding him, and not knowing what to do, he
returned, bringing with him Mr. A., then a practitioner
of the place, and excused himself to my grandfather
by saying, he hoped his lordship would not be offended;
for everybody told him Mr. A. was a good doctor.
Lord Chatham spoke to him, and desired him to
go and see the coachman, which he did, and then
returned again to report what was the matter with
him. Lord Chatham was so pleased with Mr. A.,
that he took him as apothecary for the servants,
then for himself; and, finding he spoke good sense on
medicine, and then on politics, he at last made him
his physician.</p>

<p>“Mr. Pitt having some intention of creating an
Order of Merit, desired the cabinet ministers each to
give their opinions in turn upon the coloured ribbon
that should be used for the decoration. Among the
rest, Lord Liverpool said he had prepared his, and
that he would call in the evening to show it to him
and me. He accordingly came. ‘You see,’ he observed
with much self-complacency, ‘I have endeavoured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
to combine such colours as will flatter the
national vanity. Here is red for the English flag,
blue for liberty, and white to denote the purity of
motive.’ There were several persons present, and
some of the toadies were full of admiration. One
cried, ‘Twas excellent;’ another, that ‘The king
would be greatly pleased with it;’ a third, ‘You had
better take it down to Windsor;’ and so on. ‘Yes,’
said I, ‘the king will be delighted with it. I myself
think the colours charming; for I know exactly how
they will look, as I have seen them very often.’ ‘Seen
them!—where?’ asked Lord L. ‘Why, in the
French soldiers’ cockades,’ answered I.</p>

<p>“Poor Lord Liverpool, who was a good sort of
man, but who had been putting himself forward in a
thing he was not fit for, and had stupidly overlooked
the tri-coloured flag, was thunderstruck. ‘What
shall I do, Lady Hester?’ cried he; ‘I have already
got five hundred yards of ribbon made: what can I
do with it?’ ‘Why,’ rejoined I, ‘it will serve, my
lord, to tie up your breeches: for, you know, you
have always such a load of papers in your breeches’
pockets, that I quite fear to see them some day fall
down.’ And so it was, doctor; he used to ram his
hands into his pockets, first on one side and then on
the other, in search of some paper or another, just as
if he was groping for an eel at the bottom of a pond.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
March 13.—The example set by Lady Hester
Stanhope’s maid, the day she came and openly abused
us, had a bad effect on Aysha, our black woman; and,
at length, after putting up with much impertinence,
we sent her back to her ladyship, with a note to say
we could not manage her. Lady Hester seized the
opportunity thus offered, of letting us feel how much
our comfort would be rendered dependent on her pleasure:
for we were informed, when looking out in the
village for a maid to take the black’s place, that one of
Lady Hester’s people had circulated a report that it
would be dangerous for any one to serve us, because
whoever did so ran a chance of being turned out of
the village; adding, that great folks like her, when a
thing displeased them, sometimes made an elephant of
a flea. So we sent to a village about four miles off,
and got a peasant girl; but she had not been with us
twenty-four hours, when, frightened at what she heard,
she went to the secretary to ask whether there was
any danger likely to accrue to her by remaining in our
service. A week passed on, and every day fresh reports
were circulated, that some mischief was intended
against us.</p>

<p>The reader will recollect that Lady Hester Stanhope,
in one of her letters (see page 55), speaks of the
repeated annoyances which the Emir Beshýr practised
against her, by interdicting the village people from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
supplying her wants, and of the steps she was obliged
to take, even of writing to our ambassador at Constantinople,
in order to counteract them. It appears
that his example was not lost upon her, and that she
did not disdain to resort to the same measures against
us. For a whole week she did not send the horse for
me, nor hold any communication with me, so that I
was precluded from making such representations to
her as otherwise I could have done. In the mean
time, we packed up our things, and resolved to depart
as soon as we could.</p>

<p>March 21.—Our situation was now becoming more
and more uncomfortable. We took long walks every
day, talking over our troubles, and contriving how we
should free ourselves from the thraldom under which
we were suffering; for we were as effectually in prison
as if we had been under bars and bolts. This may
seem incomprehensible to Europeans; but, in the East,
where the will of a powerful chieftain hangs like a
spell over every individual within his reach, it is in
vain to argue about people’s rights. Besides, out of
consideration for Lady Hester Stanhope’s name, I did
not wish to come to an open difference with her; and
I could not say precisely that she sought to injure us,
as, upon every occasion when I spent the day with
her, she alleged the most plausible reasons for her
conduct, invariably treating me individually with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
marked kindness. She was hostile to women; and,
calling all their motives of action mere caprices, she
engaged in a Quixotical warfare to set them down.
“I would have done the same,” said she, “if it had
been Sir —— —— and Lady ——, instead of
you and Mrs. ——, had she been here, and chosen to
lead him the same dance as she did when he took a
house for her at Tunbridge Wells, and then she would
not live in it, or when she rode across the lawn on a
donkey during a dinner-party, just after he had excused
her absence to the company on the score of
indisposition. For what can be more absurd in a
woman than to have followed you, as Mrs. —— has
done, all this distance, when you came upon my affairs,
and then to prevent you from acting in them in a way
that would be useful to me and yourself?”</p>

<p>On the faith of Lady Hester’s long friendship for
me, I had sailed from Europe with only money enough
to pay our passage, and a few pounds over; I, therefore,
was tied down to the spot until I had received a
remittance from England, which after-reflection had
made me order to be sent. On March 23rd, a letter
from Cyprus announced the receipt, from Marseilles,
of 2000 francs to my address. This sum was barely
sufficient to defray our passage back; in addition to
which, the personal opposition of Lady Hester Stanhope
was yet to be overcome. No one in the village<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
would dare to let his camels or mules to us, and I
knew that, at Sayda, every consular agent would
decline mixing himself up in any business against Lady
Hester, apprehensive of the harassing consequences to
which it would inevitably expose him: for it was well
known that, in speaking of people who attempted to
thwart her, her constant expression was, “If they
want a devil, let them try me, and they shall have
enough of it!”</p>

<p>March 24.—I was informed by Mr. Jasper Chasseaud,
her ladyship’s secretary, that she had given him
orders to say to such as applied for information, that
she did not prevent any one from working for us; but
that such as were employed by us in any capacity
whatever were never to serve her again. This was
tantamount to an excommunication.</p>

<p>April 1.—It was now ten or eleven days since I
had seen Lady Hester, when I received a message
from her to say she wished me to call on her; but,
for the first time, she neglected to send a horse. However,
I was resolved not to notice this omission, and
so walked over to the Dar. She received me civilly.
A long discussion began, during which her manner
was haughty and her tone loud. It is not necessary
to repeat all that passed; and the reader will already
have become tired of these petty disputes, which can
possess no general interest, except in so far as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
help to illustrate the peculiar character of a lady, who,
released from the control of law and opinion, which
restrained the development of her natural temper in
England, was here enabled to give free vent to her
disposition with perfect impunity. After a time she
grew calm. I then said I had made every preparation
for my departure, and wished to set off before the
season of the plague; for, as that malignant disease had
been sporadic in the preceding year, it is well known
in the Levant that, during the following one, it would
probably prove general.</p>

<p>April 2.—I made out a list of medicines for Lady
Hester Stanhope’s use, answered letters she had received
from Europe, and remained with her until
midnight. She related to me, at length, the whole of
what she considered the mysterious affair of X.’s
coming to this country. Her idea was, that the
Duke of B******, together with the Duke of S*****
and other arch-masons, having, at a meeting, talked
over the neglect which Mr. Pitt’s friends and others
showed her, and the loss which her political talents
were of, in a place where she could not use them for
the benefit of England, had resolved to send an emissary
to see what her wants were, and to pay her debts.
X. was chosen. “As to the man himself,” said Lady
Hester, “I thought, by the manner in which he held
his whip, that he must once have been a courier.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
When he was here, he took measurement of my rooms
for paper, carpets, &amp;c.; noted down my wants, and
said they would all be attended to. I accordingly
gave him a letter for the Duke of S*****, enclosing
one for you, which was to be given to you only in the
event of a proper provision being made for me. If
X. took all these great people’s names in vain, it is
odd that they never noticed it; for it might be, after
all, nothing more than an intrigue of X.’s, who,
having heard how successful Mr. F*****’s application
had been, thought that, by means of letters from
me, and by such interest, he could slip into a good
place too.”</p>

<p>She then spoke of Lord St. Asaph, of Mr. Compton
of Yorkshire, of Captain Blair, and others; also of
her old servant, Mrs. Fry, who had served her so
long and so faithfully, regretting she was not able to
make her any allowance, owing to the unsettled state
of her own affairs.</p>

<p>She discoursed on her health, and recapitulated the
different illnesses she had got over. She told me that
she used to say to Miss Williams—“‘Mind, if I die,
you are not to let Mr. A. have anything to do with
my affairs.’ ‘Oh! but, my lady, how could I help
it?’ Miss Williams would reply; ‘the consular
authority....’ ‘D—— the consular authority!’ I
used to say to her; ‘hire some strong peasant to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
drive him away with a good stick, if he makes his
appearance. Sell everything that I leave in the
house, if you can’t raise money enough any other way,
to pay somebody to do it, and let my body be thrown
into the sea.’ But, doctor,” she continued, “I’ll
take care he shan’t have anything to do with burying
my body; for, sooner than that, I’ll order myself to
be burned, without priest or prayer. I can’t bear that
man. What right has he over me? as I said to him,
‘Show me your firman, if that authorises you to
interfere with the nobility—you are here for merchants
and such people!’<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> No! as long as I have breath in
my body, no consul shall ever presume to enter my
doors without my leave. I broke a good stick over
the shoulders of a fellow he sent me, and told the
rascal to tell his master I would have done the same
to him had he come in person.”</p>

<p>Alluding to my departure, she observed—“Here I
shall be left to myself and my own resources: but I
am like a cork; and, though I may be kept down by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
my troubles for a little while, I soon come to the surface
again. As for keeping slaves, I only do as all
the great people here do; and as for being harsh to
them, about which you talk so much, what am I to
do? If they don’t mind me when I tell them to do
a thing, I suppose I must do something more than
talking, or else I should be murdered. And if I get
rid of slaves, why then I must take the people of the
country, who are all thieves—not thieves in great
things, but light-fingered, so that nothing in a single
room in the house is safe from them: such as will slip
a wax candle, or the mouthpiece of a pipe, or any little
thing, into their pocket, and sell it the next morning.”</p>

<p>April 3.—Our departure being no longer opposed,
Lady Hester Stanhope requested me to take a vessel
from Sayda to Cyprus, and not from Beyrout. “It
is as well,” she observed, “to avoid the Franks there,
who will bother you with a thousand questions: and,
now the matter is settled between us, the less said of
it the better.” As I assented to all this, she promised
to send next day to engage a vessel; and M.
Gerardin, the French consular agent residing at Sayda,
was employed for the purpose. I begged her to accept
the furniture, china, and glass, we had brought with
us; but she refused, alleging that the sight of what
had belonged to me would only give her pain. During<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
our conversation there happened a violent storm of
thunder and lightning, and the wet came through the
roof into the room, so that it was necessary to place
pans to catch the water. On returning home, my
own bed-room was flooded, as if half-a-dozen pails of
water had been thrown over it. The violent gusts of
wind would render it dangerous to have tiled roofs<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> to
the houses, although it is seldom that a winter passes
without the water penetrating through the flat ones,
which are general in most parts of Syria. The hurricane
carried away one side of the matting that had
been raised to screen our courtyard from the sun.</p>

<p>April 5.—Our passage was engaged in a shaktoor,
Captain Hassan Logmagi, from Sayda to Cyprus, for
three hundred piasters. I went to Lady Hester’s at
eleven in the morning, and stayed until half-past
twelve at night. She begged that all that had passed
might be forgotten.</p>

<p>I had bethought myself of an excellent young man,
named Lunardi, whose care of his master, Mr. John
Webb, of Leghorn, I had witnessed in my professional
attendance on that gentleman, during my residence at
Pisa, and I recommended him to Lady Hester. She
seemed to think, by the description I gave of him,
that he would suit her, and I wrote immediately to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
the mercantile house of Webb, James, and Co., at
Leghorn, offering him the place.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>April 6.—This was the last day I passed with Lady
Hester Stanhope: she was in bed, not being very well,
and I drank tea with her. It was the only time she
had taken tea during the many evenings I had sat with
her, and I thought she had abandoned it altogether:
however, she had not wholly forgotten this part of
English life. Although in bed, she did the honours,
as ladies do in England, sitting up and pouring out
the tea, handing the cup to me, presenting me the
cakes, &amp;c.; all which things surprised the black slave,
in a country where they are not used to see great
people do anything with their own hands: and it was
the same when I dined with her. There were three
sorts of excellent rich cakes, made of almond paste in
different ways. Travellers in the East may perhaps
recollect <dfn>mâmool</dfn>, <dfn>gharyeby</dfn>, and <dfn>baklâawy</dfn>. She asked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
me how I liked them, and, on my answering that they
were delicious, she said I should find a chest of each
sort prepared for the use of my family on the passage;
and, true enough, they had been sent to Mrs. ——
after I had come away from home.</p>

<p>After this, she produced the list of her debts, which
I read over to her, she making observations as I proceeded,
on the manner in which she had been led to
contract them. Being on the eve of my departure, I
had not time to write down what she said until I was
in the vessel; but, as far as I recollected, the first was
dated in 1827. The whole, however, originated in
charitable and benevolent motives. Among the distressed
persons whom she had assisted figured Abdallah
Pasha himself, when, upon being amerced by
the Porte, he had applied to her for a large sum of
money, which she had lent him. The next were the
wife and family of the Sheykh Beshýr, who, when the
Sheykh was imprisoned, were driven from their
princely palace, and compelled to wander and hide
themselves in distant parts of Syria. To them she
sent money and clothes. Then there was the widow
of Girius Baz, principal secretary of the Emir Beshýr,
who was reduced, by the decapitation of her husband,
and the confiscation of his property, from affluence to
poverty. Other individuals of less note had shared
her bounty. All her debts bore interest at from 15<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
to 25 per cent. When once she got into the nets of
the money-lenders, she had never been able to extricate
herself again, and the evil had gone on increasing up
to the present time, when she owed, according to a
rough calculation, nearly £14,000.</p>

<p>As soon as she had done talking of her debts, she
asked me to go and replace the list in Miss Williams’s
writing-desk, from which it had been taken, and which
was in an adjoining room. I did so; but, on returning
to her chamber-door, to re-enter and take my leave
of her, I found it bolted, and one of the maids waiting
on the outside, who told me Lady Hester would see
me no more, to spare both of us the pain of saying
farewell. I was somewhat affected for the moment,
but reflection told me she had acted rightly. Two of
her black slaves, who had got intimation of what was
passing, came and kissed my hand: the rest of the
people were all asleep, except the porter, who let me
out: and, mounting my donkey, I left the house, as I
then thought, for ever.</p>

<p>It was midnight when I got home. I found that,
during my absence, Lady Hester Stanhope had ordered
to be sent, besides the cakes and <dfn>baklâawy</dfn>
(which, of all pastry in the world, is, in many people’s
estimation, as in mine, the most delicious), a very fine
amber-headed pipe, and a large quantity of the
best <dfn>Gebely</dfn> tobacco from her own store, and had,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
moreover, given numberless directions for our comfort
on board; which acts of kindness, I trust, my family,
as well as myself, appreciated as they deserved.</p>

<p>April 7.—In the morning, mounted on asses, having
sent our baggage by camels, we set off for Sayda, where
we arrived about noon, and were lodged in a spare
room in the French khan. The French agent, with
whom I had been on terms of acquaintance for some
years, during my previous residence in Syria, well
aware of our dispute with Lady Hester Stanhope,
prudently resolved to pay his court to her by not
being very courteous to us. All the Frank families
imitated his example, and, instead of receiving ten or
fifteen visits, which we should otherwise have expected,
not one single person called upon us. So much
for friendships in the Levant.</p>

<p>April 8.—At sunset, the time which Turkish mariners
always choose for setting sail, we embarked on
board of the shaktoor, abundantly furnished with
provisions, which had also been supplied by Lady
Hester Stanhope’s orders. We did not reach Cyprus
until the morning of the 12th, owing to the extreme
fineness of the weather; for, having stood along shore
as far as Beyrout during the night, to profit by the
land breeze, our vessel’s head being once put on her
course, we had no occasion to alter a cord during the
whole passage. Our räis, or skipper, behaved with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
great attention; but I little dreamed, at the time, that
this räis was, at some future day, to cross my path
again, as will be seen in a subsequent part of the diary.</p>

<p>On landing, I found that the inn, where we had
lodged about four months before, was broken up; so
that we were obliged to remain on the strand with our
trunks and baggage, not knowing where to go. I
wrote a pencil note to the English vice-consul, in
whose house I had once lived two months; but he
sent me word that he was unable to lodge us, or even
to procure us a lodging. I addressed myself to his
dragoman, who had brought this answer, and offered
to pay handsomely for any place where we could be
housed, knowing, from my former visit to the island,
that he himself had a spacious dwelling; but he declared
he knew not where to put us, nor could he find
any one to take us in. These accumulated disappointments
made me at last begin to apprehend that
Lady Hester’s unkind interdict had reached even
Cyprus, whose doors were thus inhospitably closed
against us. We were almost in despair, when, at
length, Mr. Hanah Farkouah, the Syrian, who had
been passenger in the same ship with us from Marseilles,
hearing accidentally of our situation, came
down and conducted us to his own house, where he
entertained us with great kindness for nine days.
But, as we were somewhat confined for room, M. Balthazar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
Mattei, a rich merchant, who had a large mansion,
which he had recently built close to the sea,
made us an offer of it. It was then, and probably is
still, the best residence in Cyprus; but, as it had
never been inhabited, we felt, at first, some delicacy
in availing ourselves of his friendly proposition, especially
as it is considered a discourtesy in the East
to leave the house of one host for that of another:
but all our objections were finally overruled.</p>

<p>M. Mattei’s marine villa consisted of thirteen
rooms, a kitchen, and offices, and had a corridor sixty
feet long, where we could escape from the oppressive
heat of the day, besides a spacious terrace, where
we could inhale the sea-breeze in the evening. It
stood about ten yards from the sea, which was checked
in its nearer approach by a stone breakwater. The
saloon was of black and white marble. Its windows
projected, as a kiosk, almost over the waves; and
from it we enjoyed an expanded view of the bay and
the shipping; whilst, from a lofty belvidere, we had a
charming panorama of the town and country. It
would not be easy to find a more agreeable mansion
for a hot climate in any country.</p>

<p>We remained here four months and a half, living
on the most amicable terms with the inhabitants, and
revelling in the abundance for which this happy island
is famed. Not a drop of rain fell during the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
time. We were favoured, at different periods, with
the visits of two English travellers, who touched at
Cyprus: Mr. George Robinson, whose “Three Years
Residence in the East” is, no doubt, familiar to the
reader, and Captain Scott, who also has given a work
to the public. Her Majesty’s ship, Belvidere, Captain
Dundas, cast anchor in the roads, and I accompanied
the English vice-consul in paying his respects
to the British flag. Mr. Burns, the surgeon, as I
believe of the frigate, left an agreeable impression on
my memory; but these casual meetings in foreign
countries are like the oases in the desert: it is refreshing
to light on one, and, that left behind, with
little chance of ever seeing it again, we go on until our
good fortune presents us with another. It was thus
that three more Englishmen were seen for half an
hour, in their way from Syria to Anatolia; but they,
too, sailed away, and, as their vessel was lost to view,
I felt that regret which a lively conversation inspires,
with no hope of its renewal.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
No merchant ship offered to take us to Europe
until August; on the twenty-fourth of which month
we embarked for the Gulf of Spezia, where, after a
voyage of thirty-five days, we performed quarantine:
and thus ended, apparently for ever, my connexion
with Lady Hester Stanhope.</p>

 Lady Hester’s pronunciation in Arabic was not particularly
correct. By Murdah she meant Mahadi or Mahedi, a title,
in the Mussulman religion, equivalent to that of pontiff. This
title was given to Abulcassem Mohammed, the last of the imams
of the race of Ali, born in the year 255 of the hegira. At nine
years of age, he was shut up in a cavern by his mother, who
is supposed by the superstitious followers of Mahomet still to
keep watch over him, until he shall re-appear at the end of the
world, when he will unite himself with Jesus Christ; and the
two religions, Mussulman and Christian, being merged into
one, he will, in conjunction with our Saviour, finally overcome
the machinations of the antichrist.—<span class="smcap">Herbelot</span>,

 “The woman from a far country” remained a mystery
until the year 1835, when the Baroness de Fériat, an English
lady residing in the United States, wrote, of her own accord,
out of admiration of Lady Hester Stanhope’s character, asking
to come and live with her: when the prophecy was thought to
be fulfilled.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_50" href="#FNanchor_50" class="label">[50]</a>
 The reader must bear in mind that Lady Hester Stanhope
imagined that the consul, here alluded to in such ungentle
terms, could have no authority over travellers or residents not
occupied in mercantile pursuits, as he was a consul appointed
by the Levant Company, and not by Government: but it is no
longer so now that the Foreign Office appoints them.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_52" href="#FNanchor_52" class="label">[52]</a>
 Lunardi went to Syria, gave great satisfaction, and remained
a long time with Lady Hester Stanhope. It is the
same person of whom M. de Lamartine makes mention in the
account of his visit to her, styling him erroneously her
<i>écuyer</i> and doctor. Lunardi seems to have passed himself off
as a medical man, likewise, to the author of “Eōthen.” This
assumption of a diploma is not unusual in Turkey. I had a
servant, named Lorenzo, at Constantinople, who, after my
departure, practised as a physician with some success—I mean,
in a pecuniary sense.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_53" href="#FNanchor_53" class="label">[53]</a>
 One of these gentlemen, by name Chester, a clergyman,
I believe, has published his observations in a little work, entitled
“Three Weeks in Palestine.” It is needless to eulogize
it, as the devout sentiments which pervade its pages have
induced one of the societies for the extension of Christian
knowledge to cause it to be stereotyped. Perhaps, the
greatest merit in Mr. Chester’s publication is to have known
how to reject so much of the trash imposed upon travellers
by dragomans and consular dependants, and to have only
retained descriptions of scenes and events which he saw with
his own eyes. The book is altogether an entertaining production.</p>

<p class="p2">We now arrive at an epoch in Lady Hester Stanhope’s
life, when it might be said that her European
reputation had reached its height, and her domestic
humiliations had sunk her to the lowest ebb. She
had been visited in her retirement by so many travellers
of all the nations of the Continent, that it
might be supposed her singular mode of life was known
to almost everybody. M. Lamartine’s account of his
interview had spread abroad an undefined sort of
wonder about her mystic and singular opinions, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
the public read with avidity whatever details they
could meet with respecting her.</p>

<p>Six years had now elapsed since our separation;
and, although occasionally honoured with a letter
from her, I had given up all idea of ever seeing her
again, when, being at Nice, where I had furnished a
house, with the intention of passing two or three years
with my family, I received the following letter.</p>

<p class="p2 center">
<cite>Lady H. S. to Dr. ——.</cite>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right r2">
August 21st, 1836.
</p>

<p>I hope I shall not claim in vain the assistance of an
old friend, at the moment I most require one I can
depend upon, to settle the business of my debts, &amp;c.,
now made public. Money has been left me, which
has been concealed from me. I could hardly, at first,
believe it, until I was assured of it by a young lawyer,
who had the fact from one of my Irish relations. I
should wish you to come as soon as you can possibly
make it convenient to yourself, and return when the
business is over.</p>

<p>[I omit a passage, of no general interest, in which
Lady Hester arranges the mode of transit by which I
was to visit her, assures me that she will “think of
my family before anything else,” and refers to the
losses she had sustained by the non-payment of certain
bills.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
An English traveller, who has written, as I am
informed, a very learned work, told a person that,
when M. Lamartine’s book first came out in England,
the impression was so strong that many people, who
did not personally know me, talked of coming here to
investigate my affairs, and to offer their services, but
that they were prevented. A woman, of high rank
and good fortune,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> who has built herself a <i lang="fr">palais</i> in a
remote part of America, has announced her intention
of passing the rest of her life with me, so much has
she been struck with my situation and conduct. She
is nearly of my age; and, thirty-seven or thirty-eight
years ago—I being personally unknown to her—was
so taken with my general appearance, that she never
could divest herself of the thoughts of me, which
have ever since pursued her. At last, informed by
M. Lamartine’s book where I was to be found, she
took this extraordinary determination, and in the
spring I expect her. She is now selling her large
landed estate, preparatory to her coming. She, as
well as Lëila, the mare, is in the prophecy. (See
page 179.) The beautiful boy has also written, and is
wandering over the face of the globe, till destiny marks
the period of our meeting.</p>

<p>Such wonders, doctor! Copy these signs upon
another paper, and remain silent upon the subject.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
Bring with you your notes upon Palmyra, &amp;c.—do
not forget. Perhaps I may receive from you an answer
to my former letter by the next steamboat; but, as it
only remains an hour at Beyrout, this must be sent
off to be in waiting there. God bless you!</p>

<p class="right r2">
[Not signed.]</p>
</div><!--end letter-->

<p>(Lady Hester seems to have been interrupted in her
writing, and breaks off; but she thus resumes:)</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The little black is not twelve years old, yet she does
my bed-room, and answers the bell: she is the only
good-tempered black I have seen; so I try to please
her, poor thing! If you come, I should, therefore,
wish (if not too expensive) that you should bring, as
an encouragement, a pair of ear-rings, a string of
beads, a pair of bracelets, and a thimble. Her ears,
having been spoilt with boring and heavy ear-rings,
were obliged to be bored again, very high, nearer the
face—it is a beautiful ear.</p>

<p>Now, what I want for myself is six cups and
saucers; the top, I think, four inches in diameter;
height, four inches; foot, two inches. I had a cup
I was so fond of; for tea and coffee tasted so good
out of it! It was strong and good china, but it is
gone: and one cup held enough for my breakfast—a
moderate cup and a half. I want also a teapot, black
or red, or what you like; two cream-jugs; four milk-jugs,
in case two are broken,—being always in use—one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
for hot and one for cold milk; six plates; four
glass things, for butter and honey; a toast-rack, not
plated—a plated one for strangers; a dozen basins;
some little phials and corks; a few common candlesticks,
brass, or something strong; a few common
entangling combs; a few scrubbing-brushes for the
kitchen—that is all.</p>

<p>I do not want any books, having no one to read to
me: it even puts my eyes out to write this.</p>

<p>I have heard of your situation, and it pains me
beyond expression. Here you might, I believe, have
been happy, and I also comfortable, as I have confidence
in your integrity; and, whilst you were regulating
all as I should have wished, you would have
pursued those avocations most pleasing to your taste.
What advice can I give you that I have not already
given fifty times?</p>

<p>Of myself, I can say but little which is amusing;
for, from the time the Egyptian troops entered this
country until now, I have been in hot water. After
the siege,<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> all that remained of the wretched population
fled here, and my house and the village were, for the
space of three years, the tower of Babel. Indeed, it
was only at the beginning of this year that I got rid
of the last of eighteen persons of one family, all orphans
and widows; and only a lad, who was not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
capable, from his want of education, of gaining anything
for himself and family, remained. I had, at
one time, seventy-five coverlets out for strangers,
chiefly soldiers—the village full of families—and those
at Sayda and other places coming and going for a
little money to buy their daily bread.</p>

<p>I have saved many lives by my energy and determination,
and have stood alone in such a storm! All
trembled, Franks as much as the rest; and, if they
pretended to act with a little spirit, they were sure
to have folly, and not justice, on their side, and to be
at last obliged to give in: but the most of them
joined, heart and hand, with the usurpers, whom I
have treated without mercy, and, in the end, carried
all before me. God helped me in all; for, otherwise,
I never could have got through with it, having no one
of any sort of use to me.</p>

<p>Lunardi, Mr. Webb’s man, whom you so strongly
recommended to me, turned himself into a doctor, and
was too much taken up with his new title to be of any
use to me: yet this useless Lunardi is a good-hearted
fellow. Were you to see him now, however, you
would hardly know him; his manners are so improved,
as well as his understanding: I believe, also, that
he is attached to me.</p>

<p>Anxiety, agitation, and fatigue, together with the
violent passions I sometimes put myself in, caused me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
only a year ago, to vomit blood enough several times
to have killed a horse. In seven days it stopped;
but yet I was obliged to be bled eleven times in four
months and a half, fearing a return. Yesterday, I
was working like a <i>fellah</i> [ploughman] in my garden.
I am very thin, but contented about my health, as
this gives proof of my natural strength. With the
blood running out of my mouth, I was collected
enough to give orders respecting a man, who, if he
had been caught, would have lost his head; and no
soul in the family knew of this but one, who insisted
on seeing me in the state I was in: and although I
could hardly speak, I reflected much, and, thank
God! settled all to my satisfaction.</p>

<p>Abdallah Pasha has behaved very ill at Constantinople—a
vain, stupid fool, without heart and without
common sense: but it is for the Sultan that I
have worked, as I am really attached to him, he being
a most superior character.</p>

<p>Your friend Urquhart will be very useful to Lord
Ponsonby, who, though a sensible man, is idle.
Should U. gain the confidence of the Turks, he may
learn their opinion of me; but he must not repeat it
to the Franks, as a great jealousy exists respecting my
politics. I have long foretold the change that must
take place in those of the French and English, and now
say that Sultan Mahmood will be <i>mansôor</i> [victorious.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
P.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> has gambled away nearly five hundred dollars I
gave him about four years ago for things that I
wanted, and never sent me anything.</p>

<p>Do not be uneasy about my health; for an English
medical man, who came here after my illness, said he
never saw such a constitution in his life, and that my
pulse was then a better pulse than his.</p>

<p>I am reckoned here the first politician in the world,
and by some a sort of prophet. Even the Emir
[Beshýr] wonders, and is astonished; for he was not
aware of this extraordinary gift formerly: but yet,
all say—I mean enemies—that I am worse than a lion
when in a passion, and that they cannot deny I have
justice on my side.</p>

<p>Write whenever you please; do not expect me to
write, as it hurts my eyes too much, and I have no
one to assist me.</p>

<p>This summons from Lady Hester Stanhope took
me a little unexpectedly. I had not much faith
in a story like that on which she built her hopes of
paying her debts; for I did not think it likely that
property left to her could have been purposely concealed
from her knowledge, or would be withheld from
her by her relations: but, notwithstanding this, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
did not hesitate to write immediately, and say I
would come as soon as I could arrange my private
concerns, which period I limited to the following
spring.</p>

<p>Accordingly, having engaged a governess for my
daughter, to be at the same time a companion for my
wife in the long evenings during my sittings with
Lady Hester Stanhope, we left Nice on the 24th of
May, 1837, for Marseilles; and agreed there for our
passage on board of the Zoave, Captain Robert, a
tight brigantine, paying, for the exclusive use of the
cabin and our provisions, 1000 francs. We embarked
on the 6th of June, being my fifty-fourth birthday,
and, after a prosperous voyage, landed at Beyrout on
the 1st of July, 1837.</p>

<p>The city of Beyrout had undergone great changes
since the conquest of Syria by Ibrahim Pasha; not
in the tortuosity of its streets, not in its broken pavement
and the filthy entrances to its houses, but in
the appearance of its population. Formerly, a few
straggling Europeans, or Levantines in European
dresses, were seen hanging about the doors of a warehouse
or two in the Frank quarter; and occasionally
a European woman, the wife of a consul or a
merchant, would steal from one house to another, as
if afraid, in her way, of insult from a fanatic Turk.
Now, the bustle of a crowded mart was visible, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
Europeans and their ladies walked about with a freedom
which showed that a strong arm kept the
haughty Mussulman under control. In 1831, the
appearance of a French lady in the streets, wearing a
green silk gown, was signalized as a feat of great hardihood;
such an assumption of the colour peculiar to
the prophet Mahomet’s descendants generally entailing
vexations on the wearer: and a gentleman would
never have dared to give his arm to a lady out of
doors: but now, both the one and the other passed on
without any loud remark, although, internally, the
grave Mussulmans cherished a feeling of vengeance
against those who so openly violated their religious
and moral institutions. Emboldened by these changes,
I led my family through the bazars, and showed them
the busy Christians and Turks, working with their
fingers and toes those beautiful silk stuffs, purses,
cords, ribbons, &amp;c., which form the admiration of all
persons who visit the Levant.</p>

<p>We were lodged at the inn kept by Pareschivà,
formerly a servant of Mr. John Maddox, an English
gentleman, who had made a stay of two or three years
in Syria. This Greek, by his cleanliness and attention,
had secured, in an album which he kept for the
purpose, so many certificates of good entertainment
from travellers who had put up at his inn, that it
would have required some courage to raise a dissenting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
voice: but he maintained, by a continuance of the
same attentions to his guests, the reputation he had
justly acquired.</p>

<p>The environs of Beyrout had always been studded
with small villas and garden-cottages, but some very
handsome country-houses had now risen up among
them. New houses had also been built in the town;
and among them were two, the property of our old
acquaintance, M. Jasper Chasseaud, now become
American consul, one of which he inhabited. We
had the pleasure of complimenting him on his new
dignity, and partaking of his hospitality in a splendid
saloon, overlooking the shipping and port, and commanding
an extensive view of Mount Lebanon.
M. Guys, the French consul, and his estimable lady,
also entertained us; and, could our stay have been
prolonged here, we should have had no great reason
to regret the delightful society of Nice.</p>

<p>I hastened to inform Lady Hester Stanhope of our
arrival, and, whilst waiting for the camels and mules
which she would probably send, I made the necessary
preparations for the road. A cook was hired, named
Cabôor, who, some twenty or five-and-twenty years
before, had been my servant boy. Great was his joy
at seeing his old master. He was destined, however,
to remain but a short time with us, as I discovered
that he had been turned away from Lady Hester<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
Stanhope’s service, a circumstance which, of course,
rendered it impossible for me to retain him in mine.</p>

<p>We attended divine service, performed by the
American missionaries in the great saloon of M. Chasseaud’s
house, and were much edified by the exemplary
piety of these good men, who were labouring to spread
general information among the Syrians, by giving
gratuitous instruction to the children of the inhabitants,
by printing useful books of practical knowledge
in Arabic, and by leading them, through
reading and meditation, to work their own way to
salvation; trusting that an acquaintance with the
scriptures and with the advantages of civilization will
silently effect the pious object they have in view, without
those violent attempts at conversion which cause
enmity between brethren, and defeat their own end.</p>

<p>M. Guys lent us a handsome green double marquee,
and all preparations were made for our departure,
when two servants arrived from her ladyship, with her
own mules, and the following answer to my letter.</p>

<p class="p2 center">
<cite>Lady Hester Stanhope to Dr. ——, at Beyrout.</cite></p>

Djoûn, July 1, 1837.&emsp;<br>
Saturday night.
</p>

<p class="indent2">Dear Doctor,</p>

<p class="indent5">I have sent you Botrôos Metta, with the
mules necessary for your trunks and what you want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
immediately. Your heavy luggage had better go by
sea.</p>

<p>I could wish you, first of all, to come here alone, to
see a house at Sayda for your family, and to well understand
each other before you bring them here. For
your sake, I should ever wish to show civility to all
who belong to you, but caprice I will never interfere
with: for, from my early youth, I have been taught to
despise it. Botrôos Metta, if he can be useful to
Mrs. ——, may remain until your return; if not, he
will come with you. I hope your health is quite
recovered, and, in the end, that you will have no
reason to regret your voyage.</p>

<p class="center">
Yours, sincerely,
</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>So then, thought I, the past is never to be forgotten;
and, hardly have we set foot on the shores of
Syria, but war is declared against my wife. Lady
Hester Stanhope made no mystery of her likes and
dislikes; and Botrôos Metta, in his confabulations
with Cabôor (as servants in general talk about their
masters and mistresses) dwelt on the rising storm,
which probably would soon burst. Cabôor bore no
good will to her ladyship. He had picked up a little
French, and his reflections on my situation were not
deficient in shrewdness. “Ah!” he would exclaim,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
“it will be just as it was six years ago—my mistress
crying, my lady <i lang="fr">emportée</i>, and my master trying to
satisfy both—no easy task! He will have one
woman saying one thing in one ear, and the other
saying the contrary in the other ear; well! he will
be a clever gentleman if he reconciles them!”</p>

<p>As it would not have been proper to leave my
family in an inn, I resolved to take them with me at
once to Sayda, notwithstanding Lady Hester’s suggestion
to the contrary. On the 3rd of July, at sunset,
we commenced our journey; for the weather was
too hot to travel in the daytime. It was pitch dark;
nothing whatever was visible; we could not even see
the path before us: but Abdhu, the mule-driver,
and Botrôos, led the way, and each person had a
driver by his side. We were, therefore, spared the
horrors of the surrounding scenery, which M. de Lamartine
describes in such imaginative diction. In
four hours we reached Khaldy, where the tent was
pitched on the seashore; and, after supping on a
<i lang="fr">pâté à la Perigord</i>, with which Madame Guys had
kindly provided us, and taking a cup of nice Mocha
coffee, we lay down in our clothes, and slept until the
morning star made its appearance: then, remounting,
we marched four hours more, which brought us to
Nebby Yuness, where we breakfasted on coffee and
milk and the remains of our provision basket. Here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
we rested until three in the afternoon, and then proceeded
along the seashore to Sayda. When within
about a quarter of a mile of the town-gates, we met
M. Conti, the French consular agent, and from him
learned that the earthquake had so damaged the city,
and the French khan in particular, that he could not
give us lodging in it, but politely offered us his garden,
where, under the shade of the trees, we might pitch
our tent. The gardens, or rather orchards of Sayda,
occupy a flat strip of land which intervenes between
the seashore and the foot of Mount Lebanon, from a
quarter to half a mile in width, and stretching a league
along the shore. M. Conti’s garden was on the verge
of the sands, and near the spot where we met him.
His offer was accordingly thankfully accepted; and,
turning in at the orchard gate, in about half an hour
our camp arrangements were completed, and Cabôor,
with his cooking utensils round a gipsy’s fire, was
busily occupied in preparing our supper.</p>

<p>The lovely wife of M. Pierre Gerardin, who had
also just returned to her home from Beyrout, astride
on a kedýsh,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> in the space of seven hours, alighted
from her horse at the garden-gate, when she learned
who was within, and paid us a visit. This lady was
married to a son of that Gerardin who had treated us
with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span> such politic incivility in 1831, and who had since
died. She was in the costume of a Syrian lady: her
hair hung in strait tresses down her back, and black
braids of silk fell intermingled with it, so as seemingly
to lengthen it to the bend of her knees. The whole
was bespangled with small gold money, called <i>rubiahs</i>,
of which there might be two hundred or more; and a
band, set with gold money, encircled her head, on a
level with her forehead, in the fashion of a diadem:
the whole being surmounted by a marone-coloured
skull cap, richly embroidered in gold. A cream-coloured
gown, open in front, and buttoned only at
the waist, disclosed her silk gauze chemise, which
overhung her pantaloons of silk brocade, and served
as a handkerchief to her neck. Her feet were without
stockings, and covered only by a pair of yellow
papooches. She was a lively young creature; and,
as it is common in the Levant to suppose that European
ladies who go in public unveiled must, on that
account, have much levity of conduct, she endeavoured
to imitate what she fancied to be their
manners by an assumed freedom, which certainly
shocked the females of our party. Mulberries were
brought, and eaten with little pointed wooden picks,
not to stain the fingers. When our new friends were
gone, we supped or dined, and passed the night beneath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
the tent, bitten most dreadfully by fleas and
musquitoes.</p>

<p>July 4.—In the morning I walked into Sayda to
see the house destined for us; but it was inconvenient,
and was still in the possession of its tenants, a Turkish
family; so that the idea of locating ourselves there was
abandoned. Then, leaving my family under the tent,
I set off for Jôon, where I arrived about sunset, it
being three hours’ ride from Sayda.</p>

<p>Lady Hester Stanhope’s reception of me was kind
and warm, but more serious than it had been in 1830;
one would have said it was a welcome, as if I had
left her a month before, and had just come back, for
she proceeded, as she called it, immediately to business.
She told me it would have given her pleasure
if I had left my family at Beyrout, for she had no
house to offer them; and, from the dreadful effects
of the earthquake, which, on the 1st of January of
this year, had thrown down or cracked a third of
the houses throughout Palestine, it would be difficult
for me to find one, if I could not content myself
with that which had been fixed upon for us at
Sayda.</p>

<p>July 5.—This discussion occupied the whole of the
next day; when, towards evening, a letter came from
my family to say they were in the greatest trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
and fright, and that my presence was required immediately.
It was hastily determined, therefore,
that I should take them to the convent of St. Elias,
(Dayr Mar Elias, as it is called) which had been the
first residence of Lady Hester Stanhope when she
settled in this country.</p>

<p>July 6.—In the morning I rode down to the tent,
and found my whole family in tears, and apparently
inconsolable. To understand this, the reader must
fancy himself transported from a comfortable and well-furnished
home to a distant, half-civilized country,
where he does not comprehend a word of the language,
and planted under a tent in the outskirts of a city,
without bar or bolt, without table or chair, and with
nobody for an interpreter of his wants but two servants,
one of whom speaks broken French, and even
that hardly intelligible, and the other nothing but
Arabic. It is true, the ladies of the French vice-consul’s
family paid mine a visit, and assured them
there was no danger to be apprehended: but,
when I had left them, and had gone up into the
mountains, the defiles, ravines, and precipices of
which were visible from the tent, it required no
very gloomy imagination to conjure up horrors of all
sorts.</p>

<p>It so happened that, on the night of my quitting
them, a deserter, who expected to be severely bastinadoed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
or shot next morning, made his escape from
the barrack prison<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> which overhung the walls of
Sayda towards the sea, by letting himself down
through a sewer, which emptied itself into the surf.
He ran for his life along the seashore, until, seeing
a light burning in M. Conti’s garden, and a tent,
he crawled through the hedge of prickly pear in the
state he was in, and thought he might find pity, and
a temporary hiding-place. A rustling and a noise
awoke Mrs. ——, and she saw a man, in a <i>nizàm</i> dress,
wet and filthy, standing at the opening of the tent.
Her screams awoke the children, the governess, the
cook, the gardener, and Abdhu, who slept in the gardener’s
shed close by. They seized the man, who did
not attempt to escape, but told them his story; and
as all the lower classes were suffering from the oppressive
conscription, and other onerous burthens imposed
by Ibrahim Pasha, whose rule they abhorred, they
furnished the poor deserter with a little covering, and
directed him by a lane, through the gardens, towards
the mountains, where he would find holes in the rocks
to secrete himself, until he could obtain succour from
the peasantry.</p>

<p>It is not extraordinary that such an apparition as
this should have frightened them all; for, up to the
hour of my return, from ignorance of the language,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
they had hardly comprehended the circumstances that
gave rise to it. Entreaties and tears, even then, made
it imperative on me to remove them forthwith; and,
as the mules had been kept tethered on the ground in
readiness for a removal, they were reloaded; and,
threading the romantic lanes which wind through the
gardens, where lilac-trees, bananas, vines, orange and
lemon trees, of extraordinary height, with passionflowers,
and other creeping plants, wantoning among
the thick foliage, made a delicious shade, we emerged
from them at the foot of the mountain. Then, passing
the hamlet of Hellaléah, where, at the doors of their
country <i>bastides</i>,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> the <i>Kheláts</i> and <i>Dubâanys</i>, friends
of my younger days, stood watching to hail my return
among them, whilst the elders pointed to their children,
now grown up, that I might notice them, we
made a steep descent into a small torrent bed, and,
again ascending a rough and zigzag path, reached
the elevation on which stands, on a barren and unproductive
cliff, the small monastery of Mar Elias Abra,
or St. Elias, of the village of Abra, about an hour’s
ride from the gates of Sayda.</p>

<p>Mar Elias had originally been the dwelling of a few
monks, who performed the duties of a small chapel
attached to it. Being a retired and healthy spot, it
was chosen by the Bishop of the Schismatic Greeks (to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
whose see it now belonged) for his residence, and, in
1813, when Lady Hester Stanhope first went to live
there, was inhabited by one of his successors to the
see, Macarius, who was also Patriarch of Antioch. At
the request of the Emir Beshýr, prince of the Druses,
the patriarch<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> had given it up to Lady Hester, who
lived there five or six years, until she removed to Dar
Jôon. After that time she only occasionally visited
it, and, since Miss Williams’s death, had never been
there. General Loustaunau<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> occupied one of the
rooms, and an old woman, the widow of Metta, the
village doctor, with her son, lived in the lodge, and
served as porters.</p>

<p>The injuries caused by the earthquake were very
extensive. It seems to have begun somewhere near
the sea of Tiberiàd, burying the town of that name,
Suffad, and some others, in ruins, and throwing down
or damaging the greater part of the dwellings in every
city or village along the coast as far as Beyrout, which
latter place did not suffer. The monastery of Mar
Elias was shaken to its very foundations; and, on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
taking possession of our new residence, the state it
was in sufficiently showed how terrible the terrestrial
convulsion had been. General Loustaunau described
it to me as follows:—He was sitting under the
verandah which runs round a part of the small
quadrangle, reading his Bible, when his chair gave a
tilt under him. He raised his eyes from his book,
and saw the side of the building facing him rock. A
cloud of dust immediately rose above the roof. He
knew it was an earthquake, but was not, or had not
time to be, terrified; for, before he could well think
about it, it was over, and he found himself unhurt.
He never quitted the spot where he was, until his
maid, the porter, and the porter’s mother, called
to him with loud cries. When they came to
examine the mischief that had been done, they
found the store-room, which was the corner room
of the quadrangle to the north-west, entirely fallen
in, burying in its ruins more than two hundred
weight of copper utensils. The wall of the room
which formerly served as Lady Hester Stanhope’s
bed-room, next to the store-room, had peeled from top
to bottom—half having fallen, and half being left
standing. The kitchen roof had fallen in. In the
centre of the quadrangle, the parterre, bordered with
oblong freestones, had been raised perpendicularly
about two feet, with a <dfn>zenzeluct</dfn> tree, the rose-bushes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
and a palm-tree on it; and so we found them still, the
pavement giving a hollow sound to the tread. The
arch of the gate of the stable-yard was lifted out of its
curve, and the wood-house was down. The room
inhabited formerly by Monsieur Beaudin, then her
ladyship’s secretary, and now French vice-consul at
Damascus, was a heap of ruins; and numberless rents
and partial fissures manifested themselves everywhere.
The chapel, General Loustaunau’s room, the saloon,
and another large room of equal size, had escaped entirely,
together with the bath, and two or three small
rooms adjoining. The beams of what had been Lady
Hester’s bed-room were now propped up by balks of
wood; and thus we had three large rooms at our
disposal.</p>

<p>Here then I fixed my family; and hiring two
women, Tabithâ and Helôon, a girl, Werdy, and a
boy, Habyb, from the village of Abra, which was
about ten minutes’ walk from Mar Elias, as servants,
there seemed a prospect of great comfort and tranquillity
for us all, whilst I could give my undivided
attention to Lady Hester’s health and affairs, passing
my time alternately between the two places.</p>

<p class="p2">Dismissing these personal details, which have been
mentioned solely as connecting links of the main narrative,
I now resume my diary.</p>

<p>July 7.—I returned to Dar Jôon.</p>

<p>July 8.—The day after my arrival, before breakfast,
Lady Hester Stanhope being yet in bed, a servant
came for me. “I hope I have not disturbed you,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
said she, when I entered her room; “but I wanted
you just for a minute to say a word about Logmagi,
whom I am going to send home for a week or two.
Poor man! he is all devotedness to my service, but I
must not ride a willing horse to death. He is liberal-minded,
too, and charitable; not as your fine my lord
is, who gives his five guineas to a somebody, and never
feels the loss of his money; but one who, if he sees an
old captain that he has known in his younger days,
or one of his messmates, in distress, will pull off his
cloak, ay, and his jacket too, and give them to him.
When he hears any one praise me, his purse is open
to him immediately.”</p>

<p>It is necessary that I should introduce my readers
to this person, who played a very conspicuous part in
Lady Hester Stanhope’s establishment, from the year
1832 until and after this my second visit to her in
1837 and 1838. It has already been related that,
in returning to Europe in 1832, I took a passage from
Sayda to Cyprus in a boat of the country, called a
shaktôor, better known as a <dfn>tartane</dfn> lower down
the Mediterranean. The master of this boat was a
cheerful good-looking fellow, named Hassan el Logmagi,
or Hassan the Diver, so called from his first
outset in life as a sponge-diver. At the period when
I engaged him, his employment lay in the coasting-trade
from Sayda to Beyrout, Tripoli, Tyr, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
neighbouring ports. In the course of his motley existence
he had been a porter, a fisherman, a diver, a
common sailor, a slave, and a trader in small goods,
visiting almost every port in the Mediterranean and
Archipelago, buying at one what would sell at another,
and thus become acquainted with many maritime
cities of Turkey. Shortly subsequent to the date of
his carrying us to Cyprus, Abdallah Pasha made him
captain of an armed vessel in his service, and he
then was entitled fully to the rank of Räis Hassan,
or Captain Hassan, which he always afterwards bore.</p>

<p>Lady Hester Stanhope was accustomed to obtain
information from all sorts of persons, as it suited her
purpose; and, feeling some interest about our welfare
after quitting her, she sent for Hassan, on his return
to Sayda, to learn the particulars of the voyage. It
would seem that his appearance and conversation
pleased her: for, as soon as Abdallah Pasha was carried
off a prisoner to Egypt, she took him into her
service.</p>

<p>His person and manners were those of a handsome
boatswain. He was boisterous and rude, entirely
without education, for he could neither read nor write,
but very shrewd, and, from his varied intercourse
with mankind, a keen judge of character—at least, of
the dark side of human nature. He was jovial in the
highest degree, remarkably good-looking; and, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
a day’s acquaintance, when matters of interest were
out of the question, nobody who wished to be merry
could desire a pleasanter fellow. Sinbad the sailor
could not tell a more marvellous story.</p>

<p>It was matter of much surprise to the Europeans
of Beyrout, and the natives in general, how such a
man could be admitted for hours to Lady Hester
Stanhope’s conversation, and the enjoyment of her
intimate confidence; and it was a great marvel to all
Sayda, Logmagi’s native place, and where, of course,
his <i lang="fr">antecedents</i>, as the French say, were well known,
how he could have obtained so firm a footing where so
many before him had slipped. The reason will be
seen in the course of these pages, abundantly verifying
what Lady Hester very often said, that it was in
vain for people to attempt to investigate or speculate
upon her motives for what she did; and that, if two
people were placed in her room, one in one corner,
and one in the other, all day long, she would manage
her business in their presence so that they should be
no wiser in the matter than if they had been a mile
off. “Her intentions,” she would say, “were pure,
but God only was the judge of that, and she cared not
a fig what men thought.”</p>

<p>So it was; and on my arrival in Syria, I found
Logmagi installed as purveyor, steward, emissary, and
<i lang="la">factotum</i>. All transactions with the people of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
country were carried on through his hands, and a
most important part of his avocations was to keep
Lady Hester constantly informed of all sorts of matters
going on in Sayda and the surrounding country.
Anecdotes of domestic affairs, of the government, news
of every description, formed his budget every time he
came up to Jôon; and, for this purpose, about half
his time was spent in town, to be able to collect it.
He was married, had two wives, and was building a
new house principally at her ladyship’s expence.</p>

<p>The secret of Logmagi’s influence with Lady Hester
might perhaps be traced to her reliance upon his apparent
zeal in her service. She believed him to be
thoroughly devoted to her, a belief which he well
knew how to foster and sustain. He was too clever
a courtier to eulogize her to her face, and, therefore,
always made his advances by indirect means. He
had been sent by her to Marseilles, to Constantinople,
and to other distant places; and, according to Lady
Hester’s account of what he told her on his return,
there was not a person he came in contact with but
had related some history of the Sultan’s admiration of
her, of the Grand Vizir’s apprehension of her political
influence, of the extent of her reputation, even in the
very bazars, and of a hundred similar things calculated
to flatter her vanity and love of fame. At Beyrout, at
Tripoli, at Alexandria, he was sure to have met with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
a Tartar, or a sea-captain in some coffee-house, who
said he had seen a pasha, or a great merchant, or a
sheykh, or a somebody, who had declared he should
not die contented, if he had not once beheld a woman
of such extraordinary talents, or who had been so
munificent to some distressed aga, or who had relieved,
with such a liberal hand, some learned dervise: and,
after having praised her charitable heart, he generally
finished with a tale of distress of some family reduced
almost to beggary, of some honest tradesman who
wanted relief; and thus, striking the chords which
always vibrated to Lady Hester’s generous heart, he
was entrusted with large sums to distribute. He
seldom went down to Sayda without being the bearer
of one, two, three—nay, five thousand piasters at a
time, to purchase provisions with, and to give away in
donations.</p>

<p>Lady Hester had, at this time, in her service
thirty-five persons. There was one Arabic secretary,
an upper bailiff, three under ones, two men cooks, two
porters, one for each gate, three grooms, two muleteers,
two ass-drivers, whose sole occupation was
fetching water from the spring, and occasionally an
extra one; four maids and a girl for herself; three
boys, and eight men-servants. She had two mares,
which were never ridden, one horse for my riding,
and five asses, also never used, as having completed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
a certain stated period of service, and being now
placed on the superannuated list. There was a mule,
also, which was never allowed to be worked, except
by certain servants, and even then only on her ladyship’s
special commission, for some reason connected
with its star: it was afterwards given to Monsieur
Guys. The remainder of the stock consisted of three
cows and a flock of sheep. Formerly, a herd of goats
had been kept (one hundred in number), but their
throats were all ordered to be cut in one day, for
some cause which I never clearly understood, but
with the intention of defeating a scheme of the goatherd’s,
who had been detected in turning their flesh
and milk to his own account; and this slaughter,
she told me, was made in imitation of her cousin,
Lord Camelford, whose energetic character and abhorrence
of knavery she greatly admired. It was, no
doubt, also in emulation of his Lordship’s example
that, if she ever discovered that any of her domestic
animals had been put to any use contrary to her
orders, she instantly had them shot, issuing her
mandate, at the same time, that the human delinquents
should be, at a moment’s notice, turned adrift.</p>

<p>There were also three amblers in the stables. These
horses, very common in Syria, are trained by tying
leaden weights to their legs until their trot becomes
a run. Soon after my arrival, Lady Hester signified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
to me that she should have them shot, for her under-bailiffs
did nothing but ride them when they ought to
go on foot, and, moreover, treated them cruelly. Accordingly,
Osman Chaôosh, an under-bailiff, who
always carried a silver-headed stick in his hand, the
emblem of the office of chaôoshes, of whom many are
kept in the employ of Pashas as a sort of police-officers,
was commissioned to be their executioner.
He received his orders from Lady Hester herself to
this effect. “Osman, you will say to each horse,
before you shoot him, putting your mouth close to
his ear, ‘You have now worked enough on the earth;
your mistress fears you might fall, in your old age,
into the hands of cruel men, and she, therefore, dismisses
you from her service.’” This order, strange as
it may appear, was actually executed to the letter,
with imperturbable gravity. Lady Hester’s mysterious
ways had given her an extraordinary ascendency over
the minds of her people; and the Syrians, who are
credulous, like all Eastern nations, were generally
disposed to believe that her ladyship really did possess
those undefined powers which are assigned to demonology
and magic. That she herself believed in the
transmigration of souls she frequently avowed, and her
faith in aërial spirits also admits of no doubt.</p>

<p>Throughout Syria, and, I believe, the whole
Ottoman empire, the belief in magic and charms is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
universal. There is not a single person who does not
resort to some means for counteracting the effect of
the evil eye—such as spells by written papers, enchantments,
and the like. Impotence, estrangement
of affection, the murrain in cattle, blight in fruit-trees,
anything the cause of which is not immediately
obvious, is universally accounted for by witchcraft.
Lady Hester, indeed, had imbibed all these notions;
and, to judge from the substance of many conversations
she held on the subject, no reasonable doubt can be
entertained of the startling fact, that she placed implicit
faith in them.</p>

<p>“Astrology,” she would say, “is confined to the
influence of the stars over people’s birth and actions;
but magic has to do with the devil. Sometimes it is
by compact; as when, for a certain price, I say, for
example, to an evil spirit, ‘If you will tell me what
they have written from the Porte to Abdallah Pasha,
I will do so and so;’ or if, by means which I know to
be powerful enough to bring devils under my command,
I say to them, ‘You must do this, and that,
and the other,’ they are obliged to obey, or I annihilate
them.</p>

<p>“There are persons,” she continued, “who can
write charms, by which they can effect the most diabolical
purposes: but their charms are sometimes
baffled by higher influences. I am an example: my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
star, more powerful than that on which they rely,
renders their magic useless. So far, there is a connection
between astrology and magic. But take care,
doctor, there are men here who will slip a paper into
your pocket unknown to you, and make you an idiot,
or blind, or a hundred things. Always keep at a
distance from Girius Gemmal—that man is an agent
of the devil.</p>

<p>“Why, do you know that a woman’s evil eye once
fell upon me? I felt a strange pricking just above
my knee; and soon after there appeared, first, an oval
black rim, then a bluish ground within it, and then a
black spot in the centre, so that any one might have
said, ‘There is an eye:’ after a few days it disappeared.
There was a man near Cara, between Damascus
and Aleppo, who possessed the faculty of the
evil eye so strongly that he could kill a person, when
he chose to use his power to the utmost.”</p>

<p>Now all this, the reader will say, looks like the
grossest credulity. But, setting aside the observation
that the greatest men among the ancients, as we know
from their writings, entertained a similar creed, and
that many eminent philosophers and jurisconsults, as
Lord Bacon and Sir Matthew Hale, were actuated by
similar convictions, it may be conjectured that Lady
Hester Stanhope knew very well what a powerful
weapon was this superstition, placed in the hands of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
those who understood how to make use of it. Whether
premeditatedly or not, she more than once brought
crafty and designing knaves into signal disrepute by
attributing to them dealings of this sort, and thus
punished or kept in awe those whose villanous machinations
it might be impossible to detect, but of which
there was little doubt, even though not tangible by
the hand of justice.</p>

<p>Lady Hester Stanhope once built a new room; and,
just before she was going to inhabit it, from some
cause, imagined, or pretended to imagine, it was
charmed. We may judge of the builder’s surprise,
when she sent for him, and said, “To-morrow you
must assemble your workmen, and pull down the new
room.” The man, fancying some defect had been
discovered in his workmanship, humbly begged her
to say what it was that moved her displeasure, as,
perhaps, he might be able to find a remedy for it,
without destroying the whole. “Your business, sir,”
answered Lady Hester, in that tone of voice which
she made so terrible when she chose, “is to pull down
if I like it, I suppose, as well as to build; so be so
good as to obey my orders without farther question.”
“When they were removing the arch of the door,
doctor,” said Lady Hester, who related the story to
me, “I saw a paper fall out. I took it up and sent it
to a man versed in charms. He told me it was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
charm, written by one of my deadly enemies: and, if
I had dwelt in the room, I should have died. Only
think, how lucky it was I did what I did!</p>

<p>“Another time, when I had been ill in bed for
some weeks, I happened to be looking out from under
my eyelids, as you know I have got a way of seeing
everything when people think I see nothing, and I
observed Girius Gemmal fumble a paper between his
fingers, and dip it into a glass of lemonade that the
slave was going to give me. I said nothing, but
merely desired the slave to set the glass down. Had
I drunk it, I have no doubt I should have been his
victim. He is a terrible fellow! I warn you never
to go to the village or take your family there, because
I am afraid he would do some of you some harm. I
don’t know how he might do it: he might slip a
paper into your boot, or sprinkle a few drops of water
on your clothes, and utter some incantation; for they
have a hundred ways of inflicting maledictions.”</p>

<p>It may be as well to add here, although not occurring
at this time, that on reading an article in a
newspaper to her about vampires, she said, “I believe
in vampires, but the people in England know not how
to distinguish them. Such a being is not a mere
creation of people’s fancies.”</p>

<p>From these, and a variety of other observations,
which will be found scattered through these memoirs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
Lady Hester’s professed opinions on the subject of
charms and supernatural agency generally cannot be
mistaken. Nor, indeed, seeing how she mixed up
such opinions with the actual business of life, allowing
them to exercise a direct practical influence over her
conduct in numerous instances, can there be any reason
for supposing that she did not entirely believe in them,
to all intents and purposes, as sincerely as the Syrians
themselves. But I leave the consideration of this
curious problem to the sagacity of the reader, limiting
my more appropriate province to the simple record of
her ladyship’s actual life and conversations.</p>

<p>To return from this digression. It might be supposed
that, immediately upon my arrival, Lady Hester
would have opened the urgent business upon which
she had summoned me. No such thing. After congratulating
me upon my escape from Europe, which,
she assured me, would soon be convulsed by revolutions
from one end to the other, she entered at once
on her favourite topic—the coming of the Murdah.
But, as her opinions and proofs were pretty much the
same as those she had entertained six years before,
and which have already been related, it is not
necessary to recapitulate them.</p>

<p>July 9.—In the afternoon, I rode down to Mar
Elias to see my family, and returned the following day
to dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
July 10.—Lady Hester this day asked me if I had
ever known Beau Brummell. “I should like to see
that man again, doctor,” continued she, without waiting
for my answer. “He was no fool. I recollect his
once saying to me, in Bond Street, riding with his
bridle between his forefinger and thumb, as if he held
a pinch of snuff, ‘Dear creature! who <em>is</em> that man
you were talking to just now?’—‘Why,’ I answered,
‘that is Colonel ——.’—‘Colonel what?’ said he, in
his peculiar manner; ‘who ever heard of his father?’—So
I replied, ‘And who ever heard of George B.’s
father?’—‘Ah! Lady Hester,’ he rejoined, half-seriously,
‘who, indeed, ever heard of George B.’s
father, and who would have ever heard of George B.
himself, if he had been anything but what he is? But
you know, my dear Lady Hester, it is my folly that
is the making of me. If I did not impertinently stare
duchesses out of countenance, and nod over my
shoulder to a prince, I should be forgotten in a week:
and, if the world is so silly as to admire my absurdities,
you and I may know better, but what does that
signify?’</p>

<p>“Three of the wits of the day in my time,” observed
Lady Hester, continuing the conversation,
“were Mr. Hill, Captain Ash, and Mr. Brummell,
all odd in their way—the one for dry wit, the other
for solemn joking, and the last for foppery. Mr. Hill,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
for example, when at dinner at somebody’s house,
would draw towards him a dish of mashed potatoes
that had a mould mark on them, as if he was going to
help himself; then, eyeing it with irresistible gravity,
and looking at it very oddly with his quizzing-glass,
he would turn to the servant and say, ‘I wish you
would tell the housekeeper, my good fellow, not to sit
down on the dishes;’ pretending that he saw a mark,
as if she had sat down upon it.</p>

<p>“Brummell would commit similar freaks at the
houses of <i lang="fr">parvenus</i>, or people who were not exactly of
<i lang="fr">haut ton</i>, where, sometimes at dinner, he would all of
a sudden make horridly ludicrous grimaces, as if he
had found a hair in his soup, or would abruptly ask
for some strange Palmyrene sauce, or any out-of-the-way
name that nobody ever heard of, and then pretend
he could not eat his fish without it.”</p>

<p>As a specimen of Brummell’s audacious effrontery,
Lady Hester said that once, in the midst of a grand
ball, he asked the Duchess of Rutland—“In Heaven’s
name, my dear duchess, what is the meaning of that
extraordinary back of yours? I declare I must put
you on a backboard: you must positively walk out of
the room backwards, that I mayn’t see it.”</p>

<p>Another time he marched up to Lady Hester, who
was remarkable for the fine turn of her cheek, and the
set of her head upon her neck, and coolly took out her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
ear-rings, telling her she should not wear such things;—meaning
that they hid the best part of her face.</p>

<p>Upon one occasion he went about in a ball-room,
asking everybody where he could find a partner who
would not throw him into a perspiration, and at last
crying out—“Ah! there she is!—yes, Catherine will
do; I think I may venture with her.”—And this was
the Duchess of Rutland’s sister.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would have a dozen dukes and marquises
waiting for him, whilst he was brushing his
teeth, or dressing himself, and would turn round with
the utmost coolness, and say to them—“Well, what
do you want? don’t you see I am brushing my teeth?”
(all the while slowly moving his brush backward and
forward across his mouth, and hawking and spitting:)
then he would cry,—“Oh! there’s a spot—ah! its
nothing but a little coffee. Well, this is an excellent
powder, but I won’t let any of you have the receipt
for it.”</p>

<p>On one occasion she spoke of Mr. B. in terms of
regard, and said she should write to him, as a fellow-sufferer
like herself from fallen greatness. “I shall
tell him I understand the bedgown is in existence
(alluding to his taste in dressing-gowns when he was
a friend of the Prince of Wales). When he receives
my letter, he will say: ‘There she is again, the dear
creature! always the same:’” for I said I had seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
him once or twice at Calais, dressed very quietly, and
very much like a gentleman, with no appearance of
foppery, except when he leaned out of his lodging
window in a sort of a fine chintz dressing-gown. “Ah!”
cried Lady Hester, “those are the patterns that the
Prince sometimes used to give £100 for, to have them
like his.”</p>

<p>There was a gentleman who visited Lady Hester
Stanhope on Mount Lebanon, Mr. H*****, who, she
said, would not be an unworthy successor of Mr.
Brummell. She called him a gentlemanlike fop, who
gave her a sort of a look from top to toe of ineffable
<i lang="fr">insouciance</i>, and used to cry out, when she was telling
him some laughable story, “For God’s sake, don’t
make me laugh so: I shall die, I vow and protest: I
shall expire from laughing; now pray, Lady Hester!”</p>

<p>Something turned the conversation to the duc de
R——, who had visited her once. “I told him,” said
Lady Hester, “he had nothing like a duke about him.
‘Comment! est ce que je suis trop petit?’ he asked.
‘No,’ I replied, ‘it is not that; you neither look like
one, nor act like one.’ Oh! I trimmed him,” she
continued. “He wrote to me after he was gone, and
said he had prayed for me at Jerusalem. I wrote him
back a letter so impudent, doctor, and joked him about
a <i lang="fr">belle marquise</i>, who, by a shrewd guess, I fancied,
was his <i lang="fr">chere amie</i>, I bade him pray for her, and not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
for me, and sent him—what do you call it when there
are four lines in rhyme?—ah! a quatrain, which I
will try to recollect.” She mused a little, and then
repeated four lines something to this effect:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ne verse pas des larmes, ma chère et belle marquise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tu seras l’héroine de toutes mes entreprises;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Je prie trois dieux pour toi; et si ton héros meurt,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A eux je laisse mon ame, à toi je donne mon cœur.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Lady Hester added, “He was more like a militia
officer than a French duke, and very stingy.”</p>

<p>“Did Lord St. Asaph publish anything?” she
asked. I told her not that I knew of. “He was
very active,” she added, “and went about seeking for
antiquities everywhere: whenever he heard of anything,
off he set, and visited it. When he saw my
garden, he expressed great admiration of it, and
assured me that it was not only well kept for this
country, but better kept than many a gentleman’s
grounds in England.”</p>

<p>Saturday, July 15.—I spent this day and the next
at Mar Elias with my family, and returned to Jôon
on Monday, July 17.</p>

<p>It has already been remarked, that there were
thirty-four people in Lady Hester Stanhope’s establishment
at the time I am now speaking of, and yet
she would complain that she could not get the
slightest attendance. This, of course, was mere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
temper. Her five maids were constantly in motion,
night and day; but she had become querulous to a
degree scarcely imaginable, and was, beyond all example,
<i lang="fr">exigeante</i> in her demands on the services of
everybody about her. But, if such excessive requisition
was ever pardonable in anybody, it was in Lady
Hester Stanhope; for her vast talents seemed to lay
claim to submission from all inferior beings, and even
to exact it as a matter of justice. It was always
customary with her (as it generally is with people who
overwork their servants) to appeal first to one and
then to another, whether anybody could give less
trouble than she did. “What have my maids got to
do?” she would say: “they think themselves mightily
put upon, if I only require as much from them as
some shopkeepers wife insists upon from her housemaid:—a
set of lazy beasts, that sleep and stuff all
day, and then pretend they are mightily hard-worked.
Doctor, Logmagi says, that nothing but the korbàsh
will keep them in order; and, depend upon it, it is
so. If I did not tell them I would have them
punished, I should not get the bell answered.” It is
true she was generous to them in giving them clothes,
high wages, presents of money, new year gifts, &amp;c.;
but, whilst she bestowed with one hand, she tyrannized
with the other. These mixed extremities
of kindness and severity produced a strange effect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
upon her servants. I never knew one of them who,
after a time, did not wish to leave her service, or
who, having left it, did not wish to return. The
desire to leave her was stimulated by her restless
activity, which left nobody quiet day or night, and
her determined hostility to indolence, lies, and all
other vices common to menials in Syria: while the
anxiety to get back again might be in a great measure
traced to the dishonest gains which were so readily
made in her service, and by which her domestics so
frequently enriched themselves—to place nothing to the
account of that spell which she infallibly cast over everybody
who came within the sphere of her attraction.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that Lady Hester Stanhope
had great reason for her strictness. During her severe
illness in 1828, when Miss Williams died and she
was confined to her bed-room for three months, G. G.
and another rascal induced the girl, Fatôom, to steal
the keys of the store-room, and, whilst they waited
outside of the window, the wooden bars of which they
sawed through with the adroitness of a London housebreaker,
she handed them out much valuable property.
Every one of the trunks was opened and examined.
Hinges were wrenched off, so as to leave the locks
untouched, and the trunks were replaced against
the wall, and the bars of the window refitted
to lull suspicion. One night, as was afterwards revealed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
in a confession made by one of the maids, when
Mr. Dundas, a traveller, who was on a visit at Dar
Jôon, was sitting with Lady Hester, Fatôom took a
key from one of her ladyship’s pockets, which had
been left in her bed-room, opened a small closet, and
out of that closet took a bunch of keys, by means of
which she ransacked almost everything Lady Hester
possessed. Her beautiful Albanian dress, covered
with gold, was stolen; a gold medallion,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> commemorative
of her brother’s and General Moore’s death, at
Corunna, shared the same fate; stuffs, brocades, and
other articles of value, were all carried off.</p>

<p>But the servant who committed the heaviest robberies
was Zeyneb, a black slave, who afterwards became a
soldier’s trull. This woman, whose career throughout
was marked by every sort of profligacy, robbed
Lady Hester to the amount of many thousands of
piasters.</p>

<p>Lady Hester related, on a subsequent occasion, the
winding-up of Zeyneb’s history, in the following
words, which I wrote down April the 9th, 1838.
“When Zeyneb stole the gold medal, with General
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
Moore’s and my brother’s name upon it, I procured
all the documents relative to the theft from Cyprus,
where one of her accomplices had fled, and then sent
for Zeyneb and Farez into the saloon. I called in
Logmagi and Khalyl Mansôor as witnesses, and then,
telling the culprits what I knew, said I could hang
them if I liked. The impudent slave, Zeyneb, listened
with perfect indifference, and, in going out, stopped
up the door, and, in an ironical tone, thanked Logmagi
(who, she thought, had told me all about it). Logmagi,
surprised at her insolence, went to push her out;
when, at that moment, Abu Ali, the great black, who
had, it appears, found his way into the court in order
to support the black girl’s cause, and had been waiting
outside the saloon door, seized Logmagi, and, with
his muscular grasp, tried to throttle him. I heard a
strange noise, and went out; and there I saw Logmagi,
with his eyes starting out of his head, held down on
the ground by the negro. I caught the fellow’s hand,
although one of his pistols was directed towards me,
and with my other arm gave a back-handed stroke
across Zeyneb’s face (who was helping the black), that
knocked her down. She got up, scaled the wall, and
ran off to Sayda; and I never saw her more. I
called the Albanians, and had Abu Ali turned out of
doors directly.” After Zeyneb ran away, she threw
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
herself into the arms of the <dfn>nizam</dfn>, or soldiers, where
Lady Hester, to use her own emphatic language, left
her to rot.</p>

<p>A short detail of the annoyances to which Lady
Hester Stanhope was exposed may serve to show that
she was not angry with these women without reason.
The endless trifling acts of ignorance, awkwardness,
carelessness, forgetfulness, falsehood, and impudence,
which she used to relate to me, were quite sufficient
upon the whole, although many of them were individually
petty enough, to justify the severe control she
found it necessary to exercise over them. But then
it will be asked, why did a lady of her rank, accustomed
to all the refinements of European life, keep
such servants in her establishment?—why did she not
send for Europeans? That was the question that
everybody asked—that nobody could answer. The
real fact, probably, was this—she preferred these poor
creatures, with all their demoralization and filthy
habits, to French or English servants, because, by the
customs of the East, they were habituated to despotism
and bursts of passion, which neither English nor
French would be very likely to brook so patiently.</p>

<p>Besides, no European servants could have reconciled
themselves to the melancholy seclusion of Lady
Hester Stanhope’s establishment, or to the never-ceasing
activity, or, what is worse, the long vigils<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
required of them. Here there was no moment of
respite from doing or waiting to do. In England, the
maid looks at least for some intervals of recreation,
and expects, at all events, out of the four-and-twenty
hours, that she shall be allowed six or eight for rest.
But there was neither one nor the other at Jôon;
for, even while her ladyship was engaged with her
nightly conversations in the saloon, when little or no
waiting was required, still there was no end to the
work marked out for her servants—such as filling pipes
every quarter of an hour—by which they were kept
incessantly employed. Now, as Turkish servants
<em>turn in</em><a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> almost universally in their clothes, only
drawing a counterpane over themselves when they lie
down, they are enabled thus to steal a short sleep at
any hour they can get it, and are ready to rise at a
moment’s call. This is a great advantage, especially
to sick people: indeed, in Lady Hester’s case, it
almost compensated for all their faults. In the twinkling
of an eye, upon an emergency, the whole household,
only a moment before buried in profound sleep,
would start up on their feet; and, their duty once
over, would suddenly drop again into a deep slumber.</p>

<p>One day, I went to Lady Hester’s bed-room door,
without waiting to ascertain whether she was ready to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
receive me. It was a rule with her for many years
never to see anybody, even in her saloon, whether
coming from a distance or staying in her house, until
she had sent for them—no matter who, prince or
peasant; and she carried this species of regality to
such a length, that, on one occasion, among twenty
which might be mentioned, an English gentleman and
his wife, for both of whom she entertained a high personal
esteem, having arrived from Beyrout to within
a league of her dwelling to pay her a visit, and having
politely sent forward a servant with a letter to announce
their approach, she returned a laconic answer,
to say they would not be received. She, moreover,
was accustomed to mark, not merely the day, but the
precise hour, that persons coming to visit her were to
present themselves. She would do so with Duke
Maximilian, or with Matteo Lunardi. On the morning
to which I have referred, Lady Hester was in bed.
“What do you want?” said she, in rather an angry
tone. I replied that I had brought her a cut-glass cup
and stand for her sherbet and lemonade, as hers was
so common that it gave me pain to see her use it.
“No, doctor,” she said, “I am much obliged to you,
but you must send it away again. If I had twenty
fine things, those beasts of maids would break or steal
them all. I had some beautiful cut-glass goblets, and
they all disappeared, one after the other. Would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
you believe it? they broke one first of all, and then
Miss Williams gave out another. So they kept the
pieces of the broken one, and, every fortnight or three
weeks, came to her first with one bit and then with
another, with some plausible story of an accident, and
each time got another goblet out of her, until all were
gone. I found them out at last. The jades destroy
everything: but it is not that which gives me pain; it
is to think that I have not one person who will see me
well waited on.”</p>

<p>Happening to observe, that perhaps some allowance
should be made for their ignorance in that respect, as,
after all, they were but peasant girls and slaves, who
could not know what service was, seeing they were
unacquainted with European customs, she exclaimed,
“But my liver is destroyed by the passions I put
myself in, and I dare say you, instead of helping me,
will only make matters worse. They’ll only laugh at
you and your sensibility. I can see an idle fellow or
a rascal get a beating with the same tranquillity that
I smoke my pipe: but nobody is more tender than I
am, even when an animal suffers unjustly. I never
shall forget how two or three of the servants turned
as pale as death on hearing me on a sudden utter a
cry, because a lazy villain was driving an ass with
foal, heavily laden, down a steep bank. I go then
almost into convulsions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
“But, oh! how I detest your sentimental people,
who pretend to be full of feeling—who will cry over a
worm, and yet treat real misfortune with neglect.
There are your fine ladies that I have seen in a dining-room,
and when, by accident, an earwig has come out
of a peach, after having been half killed in opening it,
one would exclaim, ‘Oh! poor thing! you have
broken its back—do spare it—I can’t bear to see even
an insect suffer. Oh! there, my lord, how you hurt
it: stop, let me open the window and put it out.’
And then the husband drawls out, ‘My wife is quite
remarkable for her sensibility; I married her purely
for that.’ And then the wife cries, ‘Oh! now, my
lord, you are too good to say that: if I had not had a
grain of feeling, I should have learnt it from you.’
And so they go on, praising each other; and perhaps
the next morning, when she is getting into her carriage,
a poor woman, with a child at her breast, and
so starved that she has not a drop of milk, begs
charity of her; and she draws up the glass, and tells
the footman, another time, not to let those disgusting
people stand at her door.”</p>

<p>The conversation, on a subsequent occasion, having
fallen on the nasty servants, and I having assented to
the truth of what she said, regretting that her acute
feelings made her torment herself about things which
were but trifles:—“Trifles!” she vociferated; “it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
trifles, as you call them, that kill me. Everybody
comes to me. There are the very maids—if you were
only to see—when they have a hole to mend, how
they sew it up all in a spong: they even ask me how
their gowns must be cut out.”</p>

<p>This was the fact; but they came to her because
she would have it so. Many a morning have I seen
her cutting out gowns and pantaloons for them, and
stitching the parts together with her own hands. Her
talents were so versatile, that she always seemed to
have served her time to the particular work, whatever
it might be, in which you chanced to find her engaged.
I have in my possession patterns, in paper, of gowns
after the Turkish fashion, cut out by Lady Hester’s
hand; and if any of the travellers who visited her
may have had occasion to admire the dresses of her
men or maid servants, they may be assured that, even
down to the embroidery, the models for every one of
them were first designed and cut out by their accomplished
mistress.</p>

<p>Lady Hester Stanhope had another serious reason
to be discontented with her servants. Her inner
court, the gynœcium or harým, was separated from
the outer one by a door, always, or which always
ought to have been, kept locked. The key was entrusted
to one of the two men-servants who lived in
this inner court, but whose rooms were divided from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
the wing where the maids were by a screen of wainscoting,
which neither party was allowed to pass.
That was the rule, but the practice was far otherwise,
and the men were constantly haunting the maids’
rooms and the kitchen with perfect security; because
the locked door, at which everybody was obliged to
knock to get admission, gave them time to arrange
their matters so as to escape detection. Lady Hester
herself was generally in bed, and perfectly incapable
of checking their irregularities. It was not, therefore,
to be wondered at, if, every now and then, the sad
consequences were not slow in manifesting themselves.
For in Turkey, where men are never allowed to associate
with women—where the face of a female, even of
the lowest class, cannot be uncovered before the other
sex without a stain attaching to her modesty, and
sometimes to her character—the idea of placing the
two sexes in familiar juxtaposition is so foreign to all
their notions, that both the one and the other, when
such occasions present themselves, fancy all reserve is
at an end, and use their opportunities accordingly.
Chastity, in our sense of the word, social and moral,
is perhaps unknown among Mahometans. The woman
who is well guarded, or the maiden who lives strictly
under her mother’s wing, is kept chaste; but she who
is neglected thinks that there is no longer any reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
for restraint, or believes, at all events, that she does
no great wrong in thinking so.</p>

<p>Lady Hester, no doubt, knew all this better than
any one; but there was no remedy. She did not feel
sure of the good conduct of one single maid-servant.
As long as Miss Williams was alive, the awe they all
stood in of her made things go on with propriety;
but, after her death, all these disorders crept in. One
of the very European men-servants whom Lady Hester
kept as a check on the people of the country, set them
a profligate example himself, and then sought a pretext
for leaving her service. In another instance, a black
slave was found to have formed an illicit connection
with a black man. Lady Hester Stanhope obliged the
man to marry her, and gave them both their freedom.
Her ladyship did not visit these untoward events with
severity. Only, as it is a common practice in Turkey
to procure abortion, and as there is no notice taken of
such things by the public authorities, who often set
the example openly in their own harýms, all that Lady
Hester ever did in these cases was to call the offenders
before her, and tell them she would have them hanged
if they resorted to any secret means of that kind: and
she was a person to be as good as her word. Her
views in such matters were lenient and compassionate
in reference to the circumstances in which these unfortunate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
creatures were often placed; but there was
nothing she held in such utter detestation as mere
animal vices.</p>

<p>It was naturally Lady Hester’s object to enlist me
on her side into her plan of keeping her household
regulated according to the rules of the strictest decorum;
and I of course was most happy to lend my
assistance. Previous to my arrival, I had been, both
now and on my former visit in 1831, held up as a
bugbear to all the servants, and the common exclamation
in her mouth was—“Ah! when the doctor
comes, he will very soon set you to rights.” But I
was not at all, either from temperament or reflection,
ambitious of filling a post of that sort; and, although
she turned against me at different times the shafts of
ridicule, and a never-ceasing battery of abuse, I passively
but firmly declined all participation in the
severity of her measures.</p>

<p>Sunday, July 23.—I rode over to Mar Elias, and
returned again to the Dar on Monday night.</p>

<p>July 24.—Lady Hester Stanhope took a great deal
of pains to make me acquainted with all that was
going on both in the house and in the neighbourhood:
still she never touched on the property left, or said
to be left her; and it was not until August the 3rd
that the subject was fairly entered upon. But, as
what she communicated then will come in more appropriately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
when the correspondence which took place in
reference to it shall be given, we will proceed to other
matters.</p>

<p>August 4.—“The people of Europe,” said Lady
Hester, “are all, or at least the greater part of them,
fools, with their ridiculous grins, their affected ways,
and their senseless habits. In all the parties I was in
during the time I lived with Mr. Pitt—and they were
a great many—out of thousands of people, I hardly
saw ten whose conversation interested me. I smiled
when they spoke to me, and passed on; but they left
no agreeable impressions on my mind.</p>

<p>“Look at Monsieur *********, getting off his horse
half a dozen times to kiss his dog, and take him out
of his bandbox to feed him on the road from Beyrout
here: the very muleteers and servants thought him a
fool. And then, that way of thrusting his hands in
his breeches-pockets, sticking out his legs as far as he
could—what is that like?</p>

<p>“Monsieur —— is no poet, in my estimation,
although he may be an elegant versifier: he has no
sublime ideas. Compare his ideas with Shakspeare’s—that
was indeed a real poet. Oh, doctor, what
inspirations there are in that man! Even his imaginary
beings—his Ariels, his fairies, his Calibans—we
see at once are such as they would be if they had
really existed. You don’t believe in such things, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
I do, and so did Shakspeare: he, I am sure, had
great knowledge of Eastern literature, somehow or
other.</p>

<p>“Monsieur ——, with his straight body and straight
fingers, pointed his toes in my face, and then turned
to his dog and kissed him, and held long conversations
with him. They say he has £17,000 a year,
and castles and villages. He thought to make a
great effect when he was here, but he was grievously
mistaken. I gave him a letter to Abu Ghosh, who
received him very well; but when he talked about
himself, and made out that he was a great man,
Abu Ghosh said it was for my sake, and not for
his own, that he showed him as much honour as he
could.”</p>

<p>In speaking of M. Lascaris, of whom Monsieur L.
has written a great deal,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Lady Hester said M. Lascaris
had the heart of a Roman with the intrigue of a
Greek.</p>

</p>

<p class="p2">Some allusion having been made to Queen Caroline,
Lady Hester asked me what they said in England
about her trial. “Do,” said she, “tell me something
about it: did you see her?—I suppose it was like
Warren Hastings’s trial.” She continued: “I prevented
the explosion the first time, and I will tell you
how. One day, the Duke of Cumberland called on
me, and, in his accustomed manner, began—‘Well,
Lady Hester, it will be all out to-morrow: we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
printed it all, and to-morrow it will be all out.’ I
knew what he meant, and said to him, ‘Have you got
the chancellor’s leave? I, for my part, don’t like the
business at all.’—‘Why don’t you like it?’ asked the
duke. ‘Because,’ answered I, ‘I have too much
respect for royalty to desire to see it made a subject
for Grub Street songs.’ I did not say this so much
on the P. of W.’s account, as for the sake of the
P——ss ——; I dreaded the <em>other</em> disclosures to
which a business like this might lead. The duke
turned away, as if in thought, and I saw that the
same idea struck him; for, after a pause, he resumed
his position, and answered—‘You are quite right,
Lady Hester; by God! you are quite right: but
what am I to do? we have gone too far: what am I
to do?’—‘Why, I think,’ rejoined I, ‘the best thing
you can do, is to go and ask the chancellor.’ So off
he packed; and I fancy Mr. Percival, and the chancellor,
and he, talked it over, and decided on quashing
the business.</p>

<p>“Why, doctor, the papers were all printed, and it
cost Mr. Percival £10,000 out of the secret service
money to recover one copy which had been taken off
his table. Going out in a hurry, and forgetting to
lock it up, he had left the book open in his room. It
was not a thing to escape. Somebody stole it; and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
know, to a certainty, that it cost him £10,000 to get
it back again.</p>

<p>“As for the P—ss of W., I did not care about
her. She was a nasty, vulgar, impudent woman,
that was not worth telling a lie about. I never
could feel for her. If she had been a different
kind of person, one might have made up one’s mind
to swear that it was one’s self that was walking in
one’s night-clothes from one bed-room to another, and
not her royal highness. I always used to tell the
ladies in waiting, if ever they saw me closeted with
her, to contrive some excuse or other to come in and
break up the conversation. I was determined she
should never make a confidante of me. Sometimes
she would begin, ‘You know, Lady Hester, that
Sir Richard’—and then I was sure to begin to cough
or to interrupt her with, ‘Oh! I am going out to
walk,’ or whatever happened to come into my head, so
as to put a stop to her revelations.</p>

<p>“I warned the D. of B*********, that if the
commission examined me, I would make his old uncle
blush finely. If they ask me an impudent question,
I will always answer—‘I don’t understand,’ and so go
on with ‘I don’t understand, I don’t understand,’
until I make them, by that, put their questions in
such clear terms that their primosity will be finely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
puzzled: and then I’ll put the examination into the
newspapers. This frightened them all so, that they
did not know what to do. But it was I that was
really frightened—terribly, doctor, and I pretended to
be so bold about it, only to drive them from their purpose;
and I succeeded too.</p>

<p>“Oh! what an impudent woman was that P—ss
of W.! she was a downright ——. She had a
Chinese figure in one of her rooms at Blackheath,
that was wound up like a clock, and used to perform
the most extraordinary movements. How the sea-captains
used to colour up when she danced about,
exposing herself like an opera girl; and then she
gartered below the knee:—she was so low, so vulgar!
I quarrelled with her at Plymouth, for I was the only
person that ever told her the truth; and Lady Carnarvon
assured me afterwards that they had never
seen her moved so much as after a conversation I had
with her. I plainly told her it was a hanging matter,
and that she should mind what she was about. The
Prince, I intimated to her, might do her a great
deal of mischief when he became king. ‘Oh, he
will never be <em>kink</em>!’ she would reply; for a German
fortune-teller had told her she never would be queen,
and, as she believed the fortune-teller, she thought
she was safe.</p>

<p>“There was a handsome footman, who might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
been brought into the scrape, if the trial had related
to anybody but the Italian courier.” Then Lady
Hester asked me what had become of young Austin.
“I did not believe,” added she, “that the child was
anybody else’s but the reputed mother’s at Greenwich;
and, as for the P—ss of W.’s adopting it, and
making such a fuss about it, it was only pure spite to
vex the Prince. He was a nasty boy. Oh! how
Mr. Pitt used to frown, when he was brought in after
dinner, and held by a footman over the table to take
up anything out of the dessert that he liked: and,
when the P—ss used to say to Mr. Pitt—‘Don’t you
think he is a nice boy?’ he would reply, ‘I don’t
understand anything about children; your R. H. had
better ask his nurse, for she knows those things better
than I do.’ He was indeed a nasty, mischievous boy.
I once saw him at Lord Mount Edgecumbe’s, turning
over the leaves of a valuable book of plates backward
and forward with his nasty fingers, that he had just
before smeared in the ink. I told the P—ss it was a
shame to let him dirt and tear books of such value,
and she gave him another, a common one, but he
cried and whimpered, and said he would have the
first. I declared he shouldn’t, and said, if he dared
touch it, he should see what I would do. My resolute
manner frightened him. Once, he cried for a spider
on the ceiling, and, though they gave him all sorts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
playthings to divert his attention, he would have
nothing but the spider. Then there was such a calling
of footmen, and long sticks, and such a to-do! He
was a little, nasty, vulgar brat.</p>

<p>“It was unpardonable in the P—ss to lavish her
love upon such a little urchin of a boy, a little beggar,
really no better. To see him brought in every day
after dinner, bawling and kicking down the wine, and
hung up by his breeches over the table for people to
laugh at; and so ugly! Then she had five or six
more, not one of whom was pretty, except a little
midshipman, son of a beautiful woman in the Isle of
Wight. It was supposed that she kept these little
urchins to carry her love-letters: she certainly used
to employ them in that way, sometimes as a sort of
make-believe. I know that when she used to invite a
sea-captain to dinner, instead of sending a scarlet
footman in a barge, as she ought to have done, she
would tell one of these boys to go on board and give
her billet to Captain Such-a-one, and on no account
to let it fall into anybody else’s hands; making
people imagine there was a mystery, when there really
was none.</p>

<p>“Indeed, when one thinks of Lady ——, of Lord
——, and such characters, the P—ss is not so much
to blame, after all. There was no lack of bad example.
In all London, you could not find a more abandoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
character than Lord ——. He had exhausted every
species of vice known in the Palais Royal, and was so
notorious in that way that some gentlemen refused to
meet him at dinner unless they were sure of having
grave and weighty people present who could keep him
in order. Yet he is a clever, sharp man; no person
has carried on more intrigues in the very first classes:
and then to finish by marrying a woman who really
did not know who her father and mother were—strange
enough, you will say. She left him for a
Frenchman, and lives at Paris: but he is on very
good terms with her. He says she is in the right, if
she likes a Frenchman better. She came over to
England sometimes, by means of a passport, during
the war, to see him, and arrange matters about their
children.</p>

<p>“The P. had always been used to women of such
perfect cleanliness and sweetness, that it is no wonder
he was disgusted with the P—ss of W., who was a
sloven, and did not know how to put on her own
clothes. Those kind of people should let themselves
be dressed as you dress a doll. She did sometimes;
but then she was sure to spoil it all again by putting
on her stockings with the seam before, or one of them
wrong side outwards: and then her manner of fastening
them—it was shocking!</p>

<p>“Mrs. Fitzherbert had a beautiful skin; at sixty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
it was like a child’s of six years old: for I knew her
well, having passed at one time six weeks in the
same house with her: so had Lady —— and her
daughters. There are some people who are sweet by
nature, and who, even if they are not washed for a
fortnight, are free from odour; whilst there are others,
who, two hours after they have been to a bath,
generate a fusty atmosphere about them. Mrs. Fitzherbert,
likewise, had a great deal of tact in concealing
the Prince’s faults. She would say, ‘Don’t send your
letter to such a person—he is careless, and will lose
it:’ or, when he was talking foolish things, she would
tell him, ‘You are drunk to-night; do hold your
tongue.’<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>“Poor Mrs. Robinson was a woman of a different
kind, naturally good and innocent; and, perhaps, there
was personal love towards him in her composition:
but then she had no cleverness. I don’t mean in
politics, but none in common matters: she possessed
no guiding influence over him, so that he scribbled
and wrote to her things, that, if they had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
brought to light, would have stamped him with
infamy. When she died, she charged her daughter
never to part with a certain casket; but they got it
out of her for £10,000. I believe it was Lord M****
who got possession of it. But a peer told me that
there were most abominable things in those letters,
not of common debauchery, but of every nature. I,
for my part, believe he was really married to Mrs.
Robinson, and yet he left her to starve; and she
would have starved, if it had not been for Sir Henry
Halford.”</p>

<p>August 6.—This being Sunday, I spent it as usual
with my family.</p>

<p>August 7.—Lady Hester Stanhope spoke of Mr.
Canning. She said, “The first time he was introduced
to Mr. Pitt, a great deal of prosing had been
made beforehand of his talents, and when he was
gone, Mr. P. asked me what I thought of him. I
said I did not like him; for, doctor, his forehead was
bad, his eyebrows were bad, he was ill-made about
the hips; but his teeth were evenly set, although he
rarely showed them. I did not like his conversation.
Mr. C. heard of this, and, some time after, when upon
a more familiar footing with me, said, ‘So, Lady
Hester, you don’t like me.’—‘No,’ said I; ‘they told
me you were handsome, and I don’t think so.’”</p>

<p>Upon this point I ventured to observe, that much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
admiration was generally expressed of Mr. C.’s features,
more especially of the forehead. (The reader
is probably familiar with Sir Thomas Lawrence’s
portrait of him.) “Good God!” she exclaimed,
“what fools people are! A man in London does not
even know what his next door neighbour is; but he
sees him go in and out, and he says, he has a fine
open countenance and a fine forehead. Some people
thought Mr. C. had a fine forehead, because it was
bald. There was not one feature or one limb in C.
but what was vulgar, except his teeth, and I am not
sure those were not false: and why I think so is, that
once, in the House of Commons, he spit blood in his
pocket-handkerchief, and said he had a dreadful toothache.
People don’t spit blood with toothaches.</p>

<p>“I recollect once, when we were sitting at breakfast,
C. began reading some advertisements about
Macassar Oil and those sort of things, and pretended
not to know what they meant; and afterwards my
maid told me that she entered his dressing-room when
he was at Putney, and was shown by his valet one of
the finest dressing-cases she had ever seen, filled with
all sorts of perfumes, which his man drew out one by
one before her.”</p>

<p>Lady Hester went on (for of Mr. C. she could never
speak calmly, and his name once introduced was sure
to lead to an angry diatribe), “Oh! Lord, when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
think of his duplicity! for it was not on matters of
this sort only, but in everything that he was deceitful.
I only regret that he ever took me in as he did. But
he was so artful as to make me believe at last in his
protestations of admiration for Mr. Pitt; and as Mr.
Pitt was surrounded by such fools as C—tl—h and
H—k—b—y,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> I thought he might be useful to him
in lightening his labours, for he was clever and wrote
well, whilst Mr. Pitt could never trust Lord C. to
draw up an official paper, without having to cross out
and correct half of it. But the first time I saw him
I thought him insincere, and told Mr. Pitt so, and I
did not scruple to add how much I disliked him. ‘Oh!’
Mr. Pitt replied, ‘he is very amusing, and when you
have seen more of him you will think so too.’—‘Well,
we shall see,’ said I. ‘You must like him,’ rejoined
Mr. Pitt, ‘he is so brilliant.’ I answered, ‘Well, if
I must I must’—but I never did. It is true I took a
great deal of pains to get him into favour again, when
he was out of favour with Mr. Pitt, but it was because
I really believed him to be Mr. Pitt’s friend, and
thought he would be another strong horse in the
stable. It was so with Sir H*** P*****. The first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
time I saw his face, I thought I had never seen so
bad a countenance: it was the spirit of evil rising up
before me; and I was not mistaken in his case any
more than in the other.</p>

<p>“Oh! when I think of C.’s deceit: how he used
to come to me, and cry out, ‘Ah, Lady Hester, what
have I not done to please you? I have drunk a glass
of wine with that fool H.; a glass of wine!—such a
glass of wine!—’twas like physic to me.’ Why, I
have seen him, at Mr. Pitt’s table, pretend not to hear
when Lord H. spoke to him. Mr. Pitt used to say,
‘What does he mean by all this? If he does not like
him, why does he come to my table when he is to be
there? But I know how I could reconcile them; if I
would but give C. a place in the cabinet, he would
make it up directly; but he shan’t have it. No,’ said
he, ‘C. shall never have a place in the cabinet whilst
I have a voice.’</p>

<p>“His duplicity was perfect. He used to say to
me, ‘My dear Lady Hester, how could I ever drink
a glass of wine with a man whom I have so ridiculed,
whom I have made verses on?’ and after that I have
seen him professing the warmest friendship for this
same man, the object of so much ridicule and contempt.
I have still by me one of his letters—one of
the only two I ever kept—that he wrote me, of four
sheets, before Mr. Pitt’s death (and which I always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
kept, because I feared how it would be), in which he
goes on, for ten pages I really think, with ‘My dearest
Lady Hester, what is the meaning of all this? I
know no more of all that is passing than the child
unborn. Do write to me; do tell me; they have
made Lord Mulgrave minister,’ &amp;c.; and all this time
he was...!</p>

<p>“One day Miss Williams saw the paragraph in the
newspaper where Mr. C. was gazetted as prime
minister, and she immediately brought it, and showed
it to me. I said to her, ‘Was ever anything so monstrous?
why, when he paces those rooms in Downing
Street, which have witnessed his lies and his deceit,
the very stones will rise up to crush him.’ I remember,
when Mr. Pitt was lying ill at Bath, one day
there were no letters. Charles came in, and Mr. Pitt
said, ‘Are there no letters?’—‘None,’ replied Charles;
‘nothing but that C. is going on very well.’—‘Very
well!’ was Mr. Pitt’s reply; ‘to be sure he will go on
very well, as long as he has got your sister to guide
him; but if ever she quits him, that ambitious ——
of his—badly ambitious—will soon spoil all the good
Hester has done for him.’ How could he live in
Downing Street, and enter those rooms where I have
had him before me, crying like a child—yes, doctor,
I used to make him cry and blubber like a schoolboy—and
making a thousand protestations, which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
never kept! How could he dare to talk of Mr. Pitt’s
principles!<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>“He sent me once a fine copy of verses—they were
very well written—in which he compared Mr. Pitt to
a bound eagle. Oh! how Lord Temple tried to steal
them! He snatched them away from me one evening,
when he, James, and I were together, and, jumping
into a chair, held them out of my reach. I was so
angry that I pulled a fine repeater out of his fob, and
dashed it the ground. He then ran into the street
without his hat, and James after him, and the watchman
took him for a thief, and joined in the pursuit:
but I got them back.” Lady Hester here made a
pause, and then added: “I know C. would, if he
could, he and all his creatures, have annihilated me.</p>

<p>“Another reason why Mr. Pitt disliked C. was,
that he was not to be trusted. Mr. Pitt used to say,
‘I don’t understand what it is that people mean, when
they go and repeat every word they hear in society to
their intimate friend, their <em>as myself</em>.’ For he had
seen in ‘The Oracle’ whole conversations:<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> not that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>C. put them in himself, but that he told them to some
friend, and then, a week or a fortnight after, one saw,
‘We are credibly informed—we have reason to believe,’
with every syllable Mr. Pitt had talked about,
put down as a piece of exclusive political information.”</p>

<p>August 10.—I went to Mar Elias, and remained a
couple of days. In the morning of the 10th, Lady
Hester Stanhope, in the course of conversation, said,
“I must send you to the chief of the serpents. You
don’t know what that means—I’ll tell you. There is
a cavern in a distant part of this country, inhabited
by a great serpent, who has hundreds of others at his
command. He has got the head of a man, the body
of a serpent, and wings: he has been seen by many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
persons, and it is all perfectly true: perhaps you
don’t believe in such things?” This was an embarrassing
question; but I tried to evade the difficulty,
by observing, that nothing was impossible to the
Almighty. “Well,” rejoined Lady Hester, “you
shall go and take a drawing of the cave.”</p>

<p>She asked me what had become of Tom Moore. I
said he had latterly made a profession of faith, and
had written a book to prove himself a good Catholic.
“I dare say it was very well written,” said she; “I
always liked that man.”—“It might be well written,”
I replied, “but his other works have been more read.”—“What
are they?” she asked. I enumerated them;
and, among the rest, his life of Sheridan, of Byron,
and of Lord E. F. “Ah! those I should like to
read,” observed Lady Hester; “we must get them.”<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Sunday, August 13.—I remained with Lady Hester,
reading and talking, until midnight. She was greatly
pleased with the “Penny Magazine,” a volume or
two of which I had with me; and, some conversation
having arisen respecting English poetry, I selected
Lord Byron’s stanzas on the dying gladiator, Wolfe’s
lines on the death of General Moore, Mr. Moore’s on
his own birthday, and Pringle’s “Alone in the desert
I love to ride.” Of Byron’s, she said, “I don’t see
much in them;” Wolfe she extolled greatly, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
thought his poetry finer than Lord Byron’s. Of
Mr. Moore she said again; “I always liked that little
man” and she laughed where he expresses a wish to
live his life over again, exclaiming, in another sense,
“Ah, I dare say he does.” Her remark on Pringle
was, “That’s a good man, I’ll venture to say; there
are some good thoughts there.” I then read the death
of Mary Queen of Scots, of Lady Jane Grey—on
the effects of tight-lacing, and on boarding-school
mismanagement. “Oh!” observed she, “if I had
time, I would write a book on Swiss governesses:
they are the most artful, nasty creatures!—you can’t
imagine.”</p>

<p>It may be recollected by some of my readers that
in her correspondence with Lord Palmerston, Lady
Hester Stanhope made use of this expression, “Whoever
had been the bearer of a disagreeable message to
me, would have found me to be a cousin of Lord
Camelford’s. She admired Lord C.’s character, and,
in some things, imitated him. His name happened
to be mentioned, and she spoke of him in the following
words:</p>

<p>“Lord Camelford was not such a man as you would
have supposed. He was tall and bony—rather pale—with
his head hanging generally a little on one
side—so. What a fright people were in wherever he
came! I recollect his taking me one evening to a party,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
and it was quite a scene to notice how the men shuffled
away, and the women stared at him. At last there
was a countess, then a little <i lang="fr">passée</i>, with a ten years’
reputation for fashionable intrigues, who came and sat
down by him on the sofa, and began talking to him.
She was a woman who had seen a great deal of the
world, and knew, as well as anybody, the true characteristics
of men of high breeding and fashion. He went
away before supper; and then how she broke out
about him! she could talk of nothing else but Lord
Camelford. Such delightful manners, such fascinating
conversation! He was quite charming, irresistible;
so well-bred, such a <i lang="fr">ton</i> about him!—and so she ran
on, in a perfect ecstasy of admiration.</p>

<p>“People were very much mistaken about him.
His generosity, and the good he did in secret, passes
all belief. He used to give £5,000 a-year to his
lawyer to distribute among distressed persons. ‘The
only condition I enjoin,’ he used to say, ‘is not to
let them know who it comes from.’ He would sometimes
dress himself in a jacket and trowsers, like a
sailor, and go to some tavern or alehouse; and if he
fell in with a poor-looking person, who had an air of
trouble or poverty, he would contrive to enter into
conversation with him, and find out all about him.
‘Come,’ he would say, ‘tell me your story, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
will tell you mine.’ He was endowed with great
penetration, and, if he saw that the man’s story was
true, he would slip fifty or a hundred pounds into his
hand, with this admonitory warning—‘Recollect, you
are not to speak of this; if you do, you will have to
answer for it in a way you don’t like.’</p>

<p>“Mr. Pitt liked him personally as much as I did;
but considerations of propriety, arising out of his position,
obliged him to keep him at a distance. How
frightened Lady Chatham was for fear he should
marry me! Lord Chatham thought to have the
Bowcourt estate (or some such name), but he was
prettily taken in; for Lord Camelford paid £50,000 to
cut off the entail, and left it to his sister. Mr. Pitt
took little or no notice of him, out of absolute fear of
the scrapes he was constantly getting into. He was
greatly perplexed about him when he shot the lieutenant:
but Lord Camelford did it from a quick
perception of what was right to be done, which
was a sort of instinct with him. He saw that the
ship’s crew was ready to mutiny, and he stopped it at
once by his resolute conduct. Everybody at home
was open-mouthed against him, until the news came
of Captain Pigot, of the Hermione, being thrown
overboard, and then all the lords and the ladies began
to tremble for their sons and nephews. Then nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
was too good for Lord Camelford, and the next mutiny
which took place in our ships showed how well
he had foreseen what would happen.</p>

<p>“I recollect once he was driving me out in his
curricle, when, at a turnpike-gate, I saw him pay the
man himself, and take some halfpence in exchange.
He turned them over two or three times in his hand
without his glove. Well, thought I, if you like to
handle dirty copper, it is a strange taste. ‘Take the
reins a moment,’ said he, giving them to me, and out
he jumped; and, before I could form the least suspicion
of what he was going to do, he rushed upon
the turnpike-man, and seized him by the throat. Of
course, there was a mob collected in a moment, and
the high-spirited horses grew so restive that I expected
nothing less than that they would start off with me.
In the midst of it all a coach and four came to the gate.
‘Ask what’s the matter,’ said a simpering sort of
gentleman, putting his head with an air out of the
coach-window, to the footman behind.—‘It’s my
Lord Camelford,’ replied the footman.—‘You may
drive on,’ was the instant ejaculation of the master,
frightened out of his senses at the bare apprehension
lest his lordship should turn to him.</p>

<p>“The row was soon over, and Lord C. resumed his
seat. ‘I dare say you thought,’ he said, very quietly,
‘that I was going to put myself in a passion. But,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
the fact is, these rascals have barrels of bad halfpence,
and they pass them in change to the people
who go through the gate. Some poor carter perhaps
has nothing but this change to pay for his supper;
and, when he gets to his journey’s end, finds he can’t
get his bread and cheese. The law, ’tis true, will fine
them; but how is a poor devil to go to law?—where
can he find time? To you and me it would not signify,
but to the poor it does; and I merely wanted
to teach these blackguards a lesson, by way of showing
them that they cannot always play such tricks
with impunity.’</p>

<p>“Doctor, you should have seen, when we came
back again, how humble and cringing the turnpike-man
was. Lord C. was a true Pitt, and, like me, his
blood fired at a fraud or a bad action.”</p>

<p>A messenger had arrived in the course of the day
from Monsieur Guys, French consul at Beyrout, to
announce the landing of an Italian lady we expected
from Leghorn, whom I had engaged to join us in
Syria. Mustafa, a Turkish servant, was immediately
despatched to see to her wants; and the
secretary, who spoke Italian, sailed in a shaktôor
from Sayda to convey her by water, the heat rendering
the land journey very oppressive.</p>

<p>August 12.—I rode over to Mar Elias to see my
family, and make arrangements for the reception of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
the new comer; and, as Lady Hester Stanhope had
some business at Beyrout, which required my presence,
respecting an importunate creditor, it was decided
that I should go thither, under the plea of thanking
Monsieur and Madame Guys for the hospitality
they had shown to the Italian lady.</p>

<p>Monday, August 14, 1837.—I departed an hour
before sunrise, and reached Beyrout in the evening,
meeting on the road the half-broiled secretary, who,
in consequence of a calm, had not reached his destination
until twelve hours after Signora L. had sailed,
the little wind there was being fair for her and foul
for him.</p>

<p>Our ultimate intention in forming an engagement
with Signora L., whom we had known for some years
struggling in adversity, was to place her with
Lady Hester Stanhope as housekeeper, a situation
for which she was extremely well qualified.</p>

<p>August 18.—I remained in Beyrout the 16th and
17th, and returned to Dar Jôon on the 18th. I had
hardly dismounted from my horse, when Lady Hester
put a letter into my hands, by which I was summoned
in the greatest haste to Mar Elias, to attend
on Signora L., who, as soon as she had reached that
place, had been taken ill with a brain-fever, arising
from the fatigue of the voyage, exposure to the burning
sun, and the circumstances incidental to Eastern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
travelling, which are so strange and foreign to European
habits.</p>

<p>A messenger had been despatched, on the first
intimation that Lady Hester Stanhope had received of
Signora L.’s indisposition, to one Mustafa, a barber
at Sayda, to betake himself to Mar Elias, and bleed
her, and, when I arrived some hours afterwards, Lady
Hester strongly recommended me to leave her case in
Mustafa’s hands, as he was a surgeon as well as a
barber, and highly esteemed in Sayda for his skill.
She hinted, also, that European physicians, who applied
the same course of treatment in the East which
they were accustomed to prescribe in the north, must
inevitably do more harm than good. I acquiesced in
these observations with the best grace I could.</p>

<p>Saturday, August 19.—On reaching Mar Elias, I
was informed that, on the morning of the 14th, when
Signora L. arrived, she showed a marked oddity in
her actions, to which, at first, little attention was
paid; but that, in the succeeding night, she walked
about in an unseemly manner, almost undressed, first
in her own room and then in the quadrangle, to the
great scandal and consternation of the inmates. The
following morning, she cut off her hair, close to the
roots, with her own hand; and her conduct at last
excited so much alarm, that it was considered necessary
to send for me without loss of time. The next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
day, which was the 16th, left no doubt of her brain
being disordered, as she sung, and danced, and
laughed, without intermission, saying and doing the
most extravagant things. She had already been bled
when I saw her, and her bed had been removed
into the chapel, the most airy part of the dwelling.
The bleeding, although continued until she fainted,
had produced no effect; and in the night she tore off
the bandages, with the loss of a still greater quantity
of blood. A blister was put on her head, and medicine
was administered; but certain things which I
observed on the 20th and 21st, such as putting ice,
not only on her head, but on her abdomen, administering
pepper in powder, and a written paper macerated
in water, as a charm, to drink, together with sundry
superstitious and empirical remedies, induced me to
ride over to Lady Hester, and to tell her I could have
nothing to do with the treatment, unless Mustafa was
instantly sent about his business. But Lady Hester
Stanhope had lived so long in the East that charms,
popular remedies, and quackery, were more in unison
with her notions than rational and scholastic rules of
nosology. She therefore replied that, as Signora L.
had come to be in her service, she presumed she might
direct what she chose to have done, and that she
should confide her wholly to Hadj Mustafa’s care. I
told her I disclaimed all responsibility as to the consequences.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
Lady Hester then despatched two men-servants
to fetch from Jôon or Sayda whatever Mustafa
might require, retaining him, at the same time, to
remain in constant attendance on the poor invalid,
with strict injunctions to spare no trouble nor money
which the case might require.</p>

<p>August 23.—I went back to Mar Elias to make
these arrangements known, and to tell the governess,
Miss Longchamp, and the maids to let the Signora
L. want for nothing. Miss L. was, night and day,
at her bedside, and the maids assisted in turn. Everything
was done that could be thought of to make her
situation comfortable: but her case was now become
one of maniacal delirium. She raved without intermission:
she knew nobody; she closed her teeth, and
refused the admission of food. If her arms were free
for a moment, she tore her bandages, her garments,
and the bedclothes; sometimes laughing and sometimes
singing (but with much taste and execution) an
Italian song, <cite lang="it">Nel cor più non mi sento</cite>, or else <cite>Malbrook</cite>.
When she could, she rose from her bed, and
danced on the floor, being apparently pleased to get
on the cold stones. Sometimes she appeared to be
dandling a child in her arms. Her arms moved perpetually.
Now and then, her actions indicated satyriasis.
Generally, she showed by her manner that the
light was disagreeable to her, but nothing could make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
her pay attention to what was said to her. There
was a copious and frothy expectoration; but the
grinding of her teeth and straining of her eyes almost
out of their sockets was fearful: and, in such moments
of excitement, she repeatedly execrated certain <dfn>frati</dfn>,
or friars, by name. It was necessary to have the
room completely stripped of everything; for, such
was her violence, that, one night, being left but a
moment to herself, she loosened her arms, leaped out
of bed, and tore a Leghorn hat, a parasol, and half a
dozen frills, bandbox and all, to fritters.</p>

<p>August 24.—It was found necessary to make a
strait-waistcoat for her. The governess, who saw
everything that was administered, told me that Hadj
Mohammed received secret instructions from Lady
Hester Stanhope, with sundry packets.</p>

<p>August 29, Tuesday.—I rode over to Dar Jôon,
and again protested against these proceedings; but,
finding my views did not accord with Lady Hester’s,
and that she could not see me again the next day,
which was Wednesday, I returned to Mar Elias.</p>

<p>September 1.—A priest was sent for, and administered
extreme unction to Signora L., who was
now evidently sinking. For the first time, and only
for a moment, she recovered her reason so far as to
ask for water, “<cite lang="es">aqua, aqua!</cite>”—and to utter, “<cite>oime,
oime!</cite>” “I am dying;” but, immediately afterwards,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
her intellects became disordered again. I was informed
by the governess that about noon she appeared
at the last gasp, on seeing which Hadj Mustafa
jerked her pillow from under her head, threw it to a
distance, and pulled her legs straight, which pulling
he repeated each time she drew them up. This I
learned was in accordance with the usages of the
Mahometans.</p>

<p>September 2.—At nine o’clock in the morning,
Signora L. died, and at five the same afternoon was
buried in the Catholic burying-ground at Sayda, Lady
Hester Stanhope’s secretary and myself following as
chief mourners, with the French vice-consul and some
French merchants from Sayda, who paid the last
tribute to her memory. Before the body was removed,
a monk, of the order of Terra Santa, and eight
Maronite priests, collected from the town and villages
adjoining, performed a funeral service over her corpse
in the chapel where it lay. Thus ended this sad
tragedy, with every mark of respect that grief at her
loss on our part, and sympathy from the European
residents at Sayda, could testify.</p>

<p>The tenor of Lady Hester Stanhope’s mind, and
the peculiarity of her actions and habits may be
gathered from a note or two that were sent me from
Dar Jôon to Mar Elias during this poor lady’s
illness.</p>

Djoun, August 20.
</p>

<p>I send you a pair of sheets, a coverlet, and two
cotton-stuffed pillows for Madame L., and a bed; also
some arrow-root, some lemons, old newspapers, should
they be wanted, basins, &amp;c.; a bottle of <dfn>bnefsage</dfn>
(syrup of violets), and one of <dfn>werd</dfn> (syrup of roses),
which to some people is of use medicinally.</p>

<p>I hope you will find Madame L. not so ill as she
was made out to be. There must not be the least
noise; nothing is so bad for persons in her state. I
shall expect to see you to-morrow morning, and then
you can return again on Monday: I mean, I expect
to see you, if Madame L. gets better. My compliments
to Mrs. —— and Mademoiselle Longchamp:
I feel much for them.</p>

<p>I am afraid that the chapel is damp, and that a
stone roof is not good for Madame L.’s head; but
that depends upon her star. Many people can bear
to sleep under a stone roof; but I, for one, would
rather sleep out of doors in the rain. However, let
Hadj Mustafa decide, he knows best.</p>

<p>The consular seals were put on Madame L.’s effects,
an inventory having been taken of them in the presence
of General Loustaunau and Miss Longchamp.
They were then carried to Sayda, and afterwards to
Beyrout, to await the directions of her relatives
as to their disposal. Other formalities were fulfilled,
and on.</p>

<p>Sept. 7—I betook myself again to Jôon. It was
about this time, but I forgot to note when, that General
Cass, who was on a tour in the Mediterranean,
paid a visit to Lady Hester, bringing with him his
family. General Cass, it will be recollected, was, and
is now (1839), ambassador from the United States to
the Court of France. His visit, I believe, had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
been previously announced. At all events, I knew
nothing of it, and was absent at Abra, when it took
place; so that I had not the honour of seeing him or
his amiable daughters.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><p class="center">FOOTNOTES:</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_65" href="#FNanchor_65" class="label">[65]</a> Lord Malmesbury, speaking of an imprudent step which the

Malmesbury then adds: “Luckily this passed <em>before</em> dinner.”</p>

<p class="p2">Again the necessity occurs of introducing my personal
affairs, in order to keep up the thread of our
story. Madame L.’s melancholy disorder, and its
fatal termination, had left such awful impressions on
the females of my family, that they expressed an
earnest wish to remove from a scene where every
object excited some melancholy reflection. It was in
vain they were told there was no other house in the
country in which they could live so comfortably.
Their answer was, that day and night they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
haunted with the cries and frantic laugh of poor
Madame L., and that they would prefer even the most
wretched peasant’s cottage to remaining where they
were. They represented also the forlorn state in
which they were left during my absence at Lady
Hester Stanhope’s for a week and a fortnight together,
having nobody near them for a protector but General
Loustaunau, a man now eighty-two years of age, impaired
in intellect, and sinking into imbecility.</p>

<p>But Lady Hester had no consideration for all these
womanish weaknesses. Her former animosity against
Mrs. —— had not abated one jot. She held to our
agreement, that my family was to be considered as
strangers, with whom she had nothing to do; for, as
I had brought them contrary to her wishes, I must
look to them myself, without expecting any sympathy
from her. I observed to her how much more convenient
it would be for all parties if she would only
lend me one of the cottages she had empty in the
village of Jôon, which I could fit up for our temporary
dwelling, and which, from its proximity, would save
me so many journeys to and fro: but, as Cabôor had
foretold, there was no reconciling these conflicting interests.
At last she proposed an arrangement, to
which I acceded much against my will, as I knew it
would put her to great inconvenience. No news
having yet arrived from England respecting the property<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
supposed to have been bequeathed to her, she
suggested that I should set off with my family to
Beyrout or Cyprus, and live there until she had certain
advice that money was forthcoming sufficient to
pay her debts; when I could easily return and execute
those services for her which she required of me. This
plan was settled, as it appeared, finally.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Lady Hester had taken advantage
of a leisure day to enter into the full particulars
of her debts. I will therefore give some account of
their origin, and show how it was that she who, during
her residence in England after Mr. Pitt’s death, and
during the many years I was with her in Turkey, was
one of the most punctual and over-generous payers I
ever knew, could have fallen into the opposite extreme,
and have thus exposed herself to the degradation of
having duns at her gate, and her name in the mouths
of the moneyed men at Beyrout as a defaulter.</p>

<p>What I could recollect sufficiently well to write
down the same night in Lady Hester’s own words
was as follows:—“After the death of Mâalem Haym,”
said she, “the celebrated Jewish seràf or banker to
Abdallah Pasha of Acre, by whom he was strangled,
all the Jews of the pashalik were amerced. Some of
these came to me, and entreated me, for the love of
God, to lend them money to satisfy the Pasha’s extortions,
and save them from being bastinadoed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
perhaps worse. I was at that time low in purse
myself, and could only give them 3,000 piasters,
which was all I had. I subsequently lent them more,
for which they gave me in payment damaged pieces of
cloth, sixpenny pocket-handkerchiefs, and other goods,
which of course I could not dispose of except at a ruinous
loss. I knew I was cheated by them, but I was too
proud to complain.</p>

<p>“Not long after this, Abdallah Pasha himself having
been declared <i>firmanlee</i> (or outlawed) by the Porte,
six pashas, with their combined forces, were sent to
besiege him in Acre. Provisions and animals became
so scarce, that I was obliged to send people to buy
camels in the desert, and then despatch them under
the care of a Jew, of whom I had scarcely any knowledge,
to buy corn for myself and the house. When
at last, and partly by my means, Abdallah Pasha had
obtained his pardon from the Porte, but upon condition
of paying an immense fine, he pretended to sell
his pipes, shawls, carpets, and jewels, to raise the
money; for he was, or affected to be, so low in his
treasury, that the <i>delàls</i>, or auctioneers, were to be
seen hawking even his wearing-apparel in the bazar.
Among other ways of meeting the demands of the
Sultan, he applied to me to lend him as much money
as I could possibly raise; and I, not doubting that he
would repay me honourably, after drawing for what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
money I had at my disposal in England, applied to a
usurious Christian of Beyrout, who, at an exorbitant
rate of interest, furnished me with what I required.
No sooner was the rate known which I was to pay for
what I had borrowed, than Turks, Christians, and
Jews, presented themselves with offers of loans to
whatever extent I wished, all professing that their
purses were at my disposal; that it was beneath a
lady of my rank to discuss matters so paltry as money
concerns; and that all they required was merely my
signature to a scrap of paper, just acknowledging the
debt. In this way I signed small bits of paper, it is
true, but well and legally worded in Arabic, or Armenian,
or Hebrew, which I could not read, and by
which I bound myself to pay enormous interest,
varying from 25 to 50 per cent.</p>

<p>“This was the real beginning of my debts and difficulties;
for Abdallah Pasha gave me bills at thirty-one
days’ sight on Constantinople, payment of which
was deferred under one pretence or another for a year,
whilst I, in the interim, was in such want of money,
that I was reduced to a single <i>adlee</i>.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The worst of
all was that, I don’t think the Pasha wanted it, but
only pretended poverty to deceive the Porte. However,
in consequence of his failing to repay me at the
time agreed on, which repayment would have placed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
me immediately in a state of solvency, I found myself
reduced absolutely to destitution. On one occasion,
as I said, I was left without a farthing, and M. Loustaunau
went off to M. Beaudin, who was at Damascus,
and told him that, as he owed his advancement in life
in part to me, he was bound to assist me in my extremity.
M. Beaudin at first hesitated; M. Loustaunau
insisted; and B. lent me 4,000 Spanish dollars, which
I afterwards paid him.</p>

<p>“But this is not all. I was even obliged to send
my best pelisse to be sold or pawned in the bazar at
Sayda, and to sell to an Albanian soldier forty English
guineas, which my brother had given me on parting
at Gibraltar, and which I had saved in the shipwreck.</p>

<p>“Oh! doctor, about six months before Miss Williams’s
death, I was reduced so low, that, had she
died then, I should not have had money enough to
bury her. Môosa, one of the best servants I ever had,
and who died of the same fever that carried off Miss
Williams, out of his own pocket bought oil for two or
three months’ consumption, without my knowledge;
telling Miss W., who afterwards told me, that it was
not proper mylady should send for oil by pints and
quarts like poor people, which, just then, I was compelled
to do. Oh, Lord! when I think of it! One
day, when I was walking up and down, not knowing
how or where to turn, thinking I must shoot my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
horses from having nothing to feed them with, I heard
the jingling of camels’ bells, and presently a servant
came to say that there were some camels at the gate
laden with barley. This seasonable supply for the
horses was sent by some strangers, who had heard
the condition I was in; and the last adlee that I had
I gave to the camel-driver.”</p>

<p>Another time, Lady Hester gave me, in writing, a
little memorandum of the state of her finances to read,
which varies somewhat from her account by word of
mouth, although agreeing in the main. It was as
follows:</p>

<p>“My debts began in 1822—from 1822 to 1823;
and, in a couple of years, I owed £3,000, not that I
had actually borrowed that sum. I was obliged to
take up money, owing to the revolutions in the
country; I speak of the time in which there were
three pachas, with an army, encamped before the
gates of Acre, and when the Emir Beshýr, the governor
of the mountain, had fled to Egypt; and such
a number of persecuted people took refuge under my
roof, that this caused me great expense. Expecting
remittances from England at that time, which I never
received, I placed the date of the bonds for the money
which I borrowed, for only four and six months, at
twenty-five per cent. This, with their interest and
compound interest, and the loss upon the money
which I was obliged to take at the price they chose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
to give it, amounted in three years to £3,000. Now,
God knows what it is! My income would now only
simply suffice, after paying the interest of these
bonds, to pay my servants and tradespeople, and put
a little provision in my house. You must understand
that, when I drew for my pension upon Constantinople,
I paid the dollars at 6 piasters or 6½; I
received them at Beyrout at 10½, and repaid them
again in the Metouali country and at Sayda, where
I got my provisions, at 8½: therefore, I often lost
100 per cent. The house of Coutts and Co., since old
Coutts’s death, desired me only to draw my drafts
upon them through a merchant’s house at Constantinople,
and there was a serious loss and inconvenience
to me in doing so.</p>

<p>“It is the custom of this country, when persons
cannot pay their debts, to place them under arrest
by quartering soldiers upon them, who help themselves
to everything that comes in their way until the debt
is paid. I was resolved to submit myself to the custom
of the country, rather than allow the interference
of the English consul at that time, whom I detested.
I thought it would save me the trouble of telling my
story, and cast the reflection on the English name
which it deserved. As things seemed as if they must
come to a crisis, if I had no means afforded me to
avoid it, I thought the more unequivocal it was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
better: for my peace of mind then would not be
harassed by the misfortunes of others, when I was a
beggar myself. The means by which I should become
so carried no reproach with them; therefore, I prepared
my mind to submit myself to my fate with them.
The only thing that stopped me was, I was waiting
for an answer respecting the sale of a reversion; and
then, if my application did not succeed, I determined
to shoot my mares, that they might never fall into
other hands, to part with Miss Williams and the rest
of my establishment as soon as possible, and to leave
this part of the world to be never more heard of, first
putting into the hands of my creditors documents to
enable them to get all I possessed into their power, and
my pension, if they could: but this counted for nothing,
as English justice and liberality would of
course have deprived me of that.</p>

<p>“Such were my intentions, founded upon a determination
not to make any explanation to my family,
or receive any more reproaches; as I had already
received enough. Whatever I had to say was to be
said to the Americans, among whom I thought of
going, that they, at least, might feel convinced that I
inherited my grandfather’s spirit and high sense of
honour; for I never have been in the habit of taking
half measures.</p>

<p>“The number of my servants had been much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
talked of; but as these people often set off, four and
five together, in the night, and as several were constantly
absent upon leave to look after their families,
whilst others were always upon the sick list, giving
themselves fevers by over-eating, I could not possibly
get on with fewer than I had: for five men here
cannot do the work of one in Europe. What are
called dragomans and secretaries are a description of
persons even worse than the lower class—the idlest
and most inefficient of human beings.</p>

<p>“As for the persecuted people who took refuge at
my house, you must have heard, of course, of the
revolution in the mountain about 1822. For half
a day’s journey around me, all the inhabitants abandoned
their houses to Turkish and Druze soldiers.
I remained alone, tormented to death with miserable
fugitives. Terrible storms and an unusual fall
of snow destroyed a vast number of houses, and I
had only two rooms remaining in mine which were
at all habitable. Buildings and walls fell, and all
the rest were deluged with water. My health, which
was very bad, was rendered worse by the uncommon
inclemency of the season, as snow has not been
known to have fallen in the lower part of the mountain
for thirty years. The cattle died of want, and
the next harvest could not be got in for want of beasts
of burthen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span></p>

<p>“This was enough, and the rest you may imagine;
and if you never heard half of this whilst you were in
France, you must always recollect that what passes
in the interior is but little known upon the coast;
and a consul or a merchant, by his fireside, is little
better acquainted with the state of affairs than they
are at Marseilles.</p>

<p>“An old Druse had his head chained to his feet,
and was thrown into a dungeon. Several villages, like
little towns, were burnt, many women killed, and the
property of most of my friends totally destroyed;
whilst the unfortunate wives of considerable men were
hiding themselves in the snow-mountains in disguise,
trembling for their infant sons, whose fate, if got hold
of, was pretty certain. The two lads, Hanah and
Bootroos, and one of whom I had then the greatest
confidence in, were constantly wandering about in
search of these unhappy fugitives. I will not say any
more; you may judge of my feelings and situation.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Such was the rough statement Lady Hester gave
me. She alludes in it to the persecuted people who
took refuge under her roof: but, in her oral communication,
she never said a word of having afforded an
asylum to almost all the Franks in Sayda, who fled to
her residence in a panic after the battle of Navarino,
and many of whom she lodged and boarded until they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
could go back in safety: nor of the two hundred
wretched beings whom she fed and clothed, housed,
and protected, for nearly two years, after the sacking
of Acre. She never said a word of her numerous acts
of beneficence, nor of the indulgent forbearance she
showed even to those who had wronged her. Here is
an authentic case, among twenty similar ones which
might be cited.</p>

<p>Shaykh Omar ed Dyn, a puritanical Mussulman,
who kept a grocer’s shop in Sayda, was for many
years her purveyor and bailiff; and when, for want of
money, she had let her account run up to something
considerable, he took her note of hand for the amount,
and, at the end of the year, dunned her for payment.
To quiet him, she gave him a fresh note of hand,
which he required should be for double the amount.
Then he begged of her a quarter of wheat, then another;
then an entire piece of broad cloth; then this
thing, then that, until he ultimately paid himself
twice over. I well recollect, in 1831, when, one day,
I was going down to Sayda, Lady Hester’s saying to
me, “Don’t ride the chestnut horse,” (rather a valuable
one) “for, if you do, as you must pass Shaykh
Omar’s shop, he will beg it of me for his son, and I
dare not refuse him.”</p>

<p>This man, on his death-bed—for he died some time
during my absence—called his wife and children to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
his bedside, and said to them—“The Syt Mylady
owes me a sum of money; you will find her note of
hand among my papers: burn it. She has ever been
a benefactress to me, and, if I die with a little
property, it is from her generosity. You will here
promise me never to urge the claim against her; for
I have received double and treble its amount at her
hands.” They made solemn asseverations, and, after
his death, the eldest son went to Dar Jôon, and informed
Lady Hester Stanhope of their father’s dying
injunctions: often did the widow, too, repeat to her
how sacred she held them. But it had come to Lady
Hester’s certain knowledge that, notwithstanding
all these professions, the duplicity and ingratitude
which mark the natives of the country were exemplified
in this instance, as well as in all others; for
the widow had preserved the paper, and had twice
attempted to sell it, once to an Englishman, and once
to a townsman. Notwithstanding this, every year, at
the Byràm, Lady Hester gave the widow, whom her
son’s extravagance and inactivity in business had again
reduced to narrow circumstances, a handsome sum of
money.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
Lady Hester’s exceeding generous and charitable
disposition was well known; and she was consequently
besieged with tales of distress, with projects of important
discoveries, which wanted nothing in the world
to put them in motion but money, with secrets that
could be entrusted only to her, with presents that
were always sure to be paid for at treble their value.
Her creditors assailed her with letters, messages,
visits; and these she was obliged to silence by payments
in part, and increase of interest.</p>

<p>But this was not all. During the Greek revolution,
the Mediterranean was so infested by pirates, that it
was dangerous for merchants in the Levant to make
their remittances to Europe in specie, a state of things
which so considerably increased the value of bills of
exchange, that they were often bought up at a great
premium. Yet, in the face of these notorious facts,
Signor ——, a merchant at Beyrout, used to cash
many of Lady Hester’s bills on Messrs. Coutts and
Co., of London, or on Messrs. Webb and Co., of Leghorn,
at 35, 25, and 20 per cent. discount, when such
paper was actually at a premium in the market.
Mr. —— took 15, then 10, then 5 per cent. discount.
At various periods, likewise, Lady Hester had had severe
illnesses. There was no person about her, in
whom she could put confidence, but Miss Williams,
who was totally unacquainted with pecuniary affairs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
and, of course, incapable of remedying the mischief,
even if her innocent mind and artless character had
not prevented her from suspecting it. At one time,
Lady Hester had an Armenian steward, who kept his
accounts in his own language: at another time, she had
a Piedmontese, who went to Beyrout to negociate the
bills, and must have known the nature of such transactions.
Who can wonder, therefore, if all her concerns
proved ruinous to her, surrounded as she was by
adventurers and intriguers? Add to this, that various
sorts of money are current in Turkey, as many,
perhaps, as thirty, all fluctuating in value, and contributing
still more to the complication of her distresses.
It would hardly have been a matter of
wonder, even under ordinary circumstances, that she
should have been plunged into embarrassments; but,
in the peculiarly perplexing situation in which she was
placed, it was unavoidable.</p>

<p>I was witness to her signing a list of her creditors’
names, with the amount of her various responsibilities,
at her request, in case, as she said, anything should
befall her, that her creditors might know she never
had the smallest intention of defrauding them, even of
their usurious and unlawful gains. “When I get the
money,” she added, “I shall pay them all just double
what they lent me, and I think nobody can say that
is unjust.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span></p>

<p>All her creditors took 25 per cent. for the money
they lent. Supposing Lady Hester had not made any
difficulty on that head, and was willing to receive
pecuniary assistance even at that loss, why nothing
could be said about the matter. Gold was the commodity
these merchants had to sell, and they made as
much of it as they could; but she did not always get
what she had bargained for: some of the lenders sent
a part of the loan in coffee, rice, and in other merchandize.
In most cases, the gold was not of full
weight; for never was there a country in which
money-clipping is carried on to a greater extent than
in Turkey. And it is not fair to say that Jews are the
only usurers: Mussulmans and Christians are just as
bad, when the law, or other considerations, do not
coerce them into honesty. Let us take, as an example,
a Christian merchant of Beyrout.</p>

<p>Lady Hester Stanhope wanted to borrow £600;
and she applied to Mr. ——, in September, 1826,
when the exchange was at 20 piasters the Spanish
dollar: £200, consequently, are about equal to 1000
Spanish dollars; and £600 to 3000 or 60,000
Turkish piasters. Her ladyship drew on Messrs.
Coutts and Co. for £600, at one year’s date. The
merchant gives her for her bill, instead of 60,000
piasters, only 52,500, that is 17½ for the dollar instead
of 20, which was the real exchange: he gains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
at once on the transaction, 7500 piasters, or £75.
But the bill has a year to run: he, therefore, demands
a bonus for his risk, and modestly requires 1000
dollars, or £200; and Lady Hester at last receives
£325 for her £600. This sum is paid in <i>adlees</i> of
16 piastres, <i>ghazis</i> of 20, <i>roobeyas</i> of 9, and sundry
other current moneys; but, a week or two afterwards,
the pasha issues a tariff, fixing a lower value than the
current one on all the coinage of the empire, a step
customary every year just before the taxes are gathered,
by which the government gains a considerable increase
of revenue. This is known to the merchant beforehand,
who, having on his books a memorandum of
the customary rates at which the money is annually
set, or, which is more likely, having, for a consideration,
obtained private information from the government
secretaries what money will be rated lowest,
takes care to make his rouleaus consist of what he is
most desirous of ridding himself of: and Lady Hester
finds that what she has received at 20 will only pass
at 17¾, those at 9 only at 8¼, and so on; by which
another serious loss is added to all the rest. But in
August, 1837, her bill is delayed payment because
Messrs. Coutts and Co. have not the certificate of her
life for Michaelmas of that year, (delayed, probably,
in consequence of Lord Palmerston’s measures) and
she is compelled to ask time for six months more,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
which is granted on her signing a promissory note for
an additional number of dollars in the same usurious
proportion.</p>

<p>After this statement of her debts, Lady Hester next
proceeded to explain how it was she had written to me
in such haste to come over to Syria. It has already
been mentioned that, in 1836, she had been informed,
by one of her friends in England, that a considerable
estate had been bequeathed to her, the knowledge of
which was concealed from her by those privy to the
bequest.</p>

<p>The beginning of this erroneous belief seems to date
from the spring of 1836. In some letters which
passed about that time between her ladyship and the
Chevalier Henry Guys, French consul at Beyrout,
which that gentleman kindly allows me to make use
of, and which will best explain her feelings on the
subject, it will be seen that she entertained no doubt
on the subject, and was firmly persuaded that her
friends, for the purpose of forcing her to come to
England, kept her in ignorance of her good fortune,
thinking that distress must eventually drive her back
to her native country. These letters were transmitted
to me at Nice, after my manuscript had been sent to
England; but the narrative will suffer no interruption
by their introduction here, and they serve to corroborate
many portions of it.</p>

<p class="indent2">Monsieur,</p>

<p class="indent5">A thousand and a thousand pardons for
having delayed so long sending you the bills of exchange;
but Logmagi has put off his journey to
Beyrout from day to day, and I too have been in such
a bad humour that I could not write.</p>

<p>After I had given Yuness the letters, I received
one from Sayda, from my Lord H******** written in
such an agitated manner, that it cost me two days to
make it out. The date of it is the 1st of September;
then this date is scratched out, and the month of
December is put. He tells me that “he went directly
to get correct information about my money matters,
and that they excused themselves by saying, that
sometimes they did not know whether I was alive,
which was the reason of their being behind in their
payments,” &amp;c., and such <i lang="fr">bêtises</i>. About the other
affair, he writes nothing at all, only that he gives me
to understand, if I wish everything to go on well and
as I desire, I must return to England, and then there
will be such fine doings, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span></p>

<p>All this does not make me change my mind, but it
delays everything. If they won’t do me justice, they
shall be made to do it by force—by the law. Have
the goodness to put the enclosed letter to my Lord
H********, under cover to Coutts and Co., with a
life certificate, for fear the bills of exchange should not
be presented soon enough. Now that I enjoy a little
quiet, I shall settle all these matters, and all will do
well, I hope, in the end; but the excessive folly and
blindness of those people astonish me, and make me
angry, because they place me in a very awkward
situation, where I must either be deprived of what is
due to me, or hurt their reputations. If this business
becomes known in England, it will make a great
noise.</p>

<p>After having well examined my account, I find I
have got left about 400 and odd pounds sterling. Out
of the £700, you have £400, or thereabouts, in hand.
Make up a bag of 1000 dollars clear; keep 200 gazi
for things I shall want—(Yusef Boutàl, of Alexandria,
will have a bill of about 2000 piasters, which I will
thank you, in due time, to pay)—give the rest to
Logmagi for commissions, and send me by him some
fresh bills of exchange for the £400 sterling.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>God grant that the time may come, when I shall
have it in my power to return you, in some shape, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
small measure only of the politeness and attention I
have received from you.</p>

<p>Be assured, Monsieur, of my esteem and friendship.</p>

<p>Two words more, Monsieur, for Dr. ——, and a
letter for Messrs. Coutts, which be good enough to
forward. According to the report of a Greek captain,
it appears that a cousin of mine, my lord N*****
after having stopped a day or two at Cyprus, is gone
to the Carimanian coast, with the intention of coming
here afterwards. I hope he will not come to disturb
me in all I have got to say to you. He is brother of
the D—— of B——, that man who always
thwarts me in all my concerns, in the hope of making
me quit this country by compulsion. The father of
this D—— of B—— spent for the Bourbons, all
the time they were in England, £25,000 a-year.</p>

<p>Logmagi has brought me the 6,000 piasters, which
you have had the goodness to advance me. We will
settle all that on your arrival here. In the mean time,

</p>

<p class="indent2">Monsieur,</p>

<p class="indent5">I am disposed always to put full confidence
in you: here is Coutts’s account, such as it is. The
letter says nothing—only that so much money has
been paid in by such a one, probably an agent of my
brother’s son; but of that I am not sure. Send me
back the account when you have any one coming here.
No doubt I owe the payment of this sum to Lord
Hardwicke, who does not write until he has finished
it all. He is a man who has rendered me a thousand
services, without ever having made them known to
me: but chance has brought them to my knowledge.
Wait—have a little patience: God is great, and I
have right on my side.</p>

<p>Tell me if there are any opportunities for Leghorn
or France: I wish to write to the Doctor.</p>

Monday se’nnight.
</p>

<p>Mansoor is going to Beyrout to do some commissions;
but he has such a bad memory, that I shall be
no gainer by his going in what I have to say to you.
I am in want of a drawing for two ceilings (one for my
divàn-room,) after your taste and ideas, composed of
a circle in the centre and a cornucopia at each corner;
the remainder a trellis. There must be also small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
arcades. These I should like to be ornamented with
<dfn>felák</dfn><a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> flowers (I don’t know the French name); the
circular centre may have ears of corn, roses, pomegranates—I
mean chiefly. My idea of a cornucopia
you will see in the annexed sketch.</p>

<p>I have just this moment received a very long letter
from Madame de Fériat, who is delighted with the
permission I have given her to come to me. She
is making her preparations, is selling her property, &amp;c.
I fancy she must be a woman quite <em>unique.</em></p>

<p>I will write again on Sunday; but, before you let
me hear from you, will you make some inquiries
about the character of a Florentine who has written
to me. Let me know what kind of a man he is; what
he is good for. I can never get through all my
business with Mansoor alone; still those Franks are
generally detestable. His name is Renecucci, or something

</p>

<p class="indent2">Monsieur,</p>

<p class="indent5">Your letter came to hand the 17th, in the
evening, and it is with pleasure that I see the extent
of the interest you are good enough to take in my
affairs. Therefore, you will be pleased to learn that
what I intended to do will, probably, be no longer
necessary.</p>

<p>Very extraordinary circumstances have come to my
knowledge, which I cannot communicate to you by
letter.</p>

<p>I am neither afraid of plague nor of anything else;
so if you believe, as I do, that everything is destiny,
I should like to have an opportunity of profiting by
your counsel touching certain things somewhat incredible,
which have been twice repeated to me by
persons much attached to me, but who are desirous of
not being known.</p>

<p>Now I must speak to you about my money concerns.
In the course of fifteen or twenty days, I should like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
to have three letters of exchange for 1000 dollars. If
you have not the money by you, you can give the
bills to some of the English merchants, with whom I
will not have anything to do, because they wish to have
all my bills or none at all; and, as I see that my
affairs are likely to be bettered, I shall have nobody
but you. You served me well in my misfortunes,
and I wish you to see the end of them. As I fear my
letters may be stopped,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> if my handwriting were known,
I will thank you to direct one of them to Mr. A.
Kinglake, adding the name of your banker at Paris
or Marseilles. I have left that one open: you will
be good enough to seal it, and put it, as well as the
other to My lord Hardwicke, under cover, directed to
one of your friends in England.</p>

<p>Adieu, monsieur, and pray accept the assurance of
my esteem and friendship.</p>

<p>PS. I have kept back my letter a day longer,
having had an express from Beyrout, to inform me
that a medallion, belonging to me, has been found at
Cyprus—another proof of the robberies committed in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
my house. However, for the present, say nothing
about it, until they have caught the man who sold it.</p>

c’est avec plaisir que je vois l’étendue de l’intérêt que
vous avez la bonté de prendre dans mes affaires. Vous
serez ainsi content d’apprendre que ce que je voulois
faire ne sera peut-être plus nécessaire. J’ai appris des
circonstances très extraordinaires, dont je ne pourrais
vous faire part par lettre. Je ne crains ni peste ni

<p>A-présent, il faut vous parler de mes affaires
d’intérêt. Dans le courant de 15 à 20 jours, je
voudrois trois lettres de change pour 1000 talaris.
Si vous n’avez pas l’argent chez vous, vous pouvez
donner des lettres à quelqu’un de ces Anglois, avec
lesquels je n’aime pas me mêler, parcequ’ils veulent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>

je ne veux que <em>vous</em>. Vous m’avez bien servi dans le

<p>Comme je crains que l’on arrête peut-être mes lettres,
si mon écriture est connue, je vous prie d’en adresser
une à Monsieur A. Kinglake, en ajoutant le nom de
votre banquier à Paris ou à Marseille. Je l’ai laissé
ouverte. Vous la cacheterez et vous la mettrez, ainsi

<p class="indent2">Monsieur,</p>

<p class="indent5">I intended to have written to you yesterday,
when your letter reached me, to have told you that I
have found out still more robberies, and such intrigues!—but
say nothing for the present: only, I foresee, I
shall be put to great expense every way; and, if it
does not inconvenience you to wait for the amount of
the bill that was protested, until the £2,000 are paid
into your bankers’ hands, it would considerably advance
my business.</p>

<p>I have had farther accounts about the money concealed
from me. Very good! When I get it, I shall
give you plenty of commissions for France.</p>

<p>How kind you are to think about my eyesight,
which sickness and trouble have so injured! Nevertheless,
it is better than it was last year.</p>

<p>I will send you back the book by the express who
will go for the money. What day would you like he
should be with you? Half of what the writer says is
incorrect.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Before I went to Palmyra, I made an excursion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
into the Desert with Lascaris alone, keeping
the doctor and the married servants, under one pretext
or another, from accompanying me. Lascaris
and I were pursued by the Fedâan Bedouins, who
were hostile to Mohammed el Fadi; and, although
our horses never drank for two days, we rode from
ten in the morning until after midnight, without eating
or drinking, to get out of their district. Then,
again, the dispute between Lascaris and me was
about a groom, who, not knowing who he was, would
not let him enter my stables at Hamah. His pride
would not stop to listen to reason, and he ran away
(<i lang="fr">et il s’est enfuit</i>). I met him several years afterwards
at Tripoli, and he made me cry for an hour by
the excess of his grief, and the excuses which he made
me: so much so, that I, who hardly ever shed tears,
was astonished at myself. Poor man! There, indeed,
was a true courtier, with the most elegant
manners, and an inconceivable fund of knowledge, without
pedantry. It was not Napoleon that he was so much
attached to; it was to him who had the <i lang="fr">portefeuille</i>.
You know very well what he did for him.</p>

<p class="indent5">I have succeeded, at last, in finding out the
extent of the intrigues against me. The intriguers
thought to do me a great deal of harm, but, thank
God! they have done me a great deal of good, as you
will see hereafter. When the hot days are over, you
must pay me another visit, in order for me to make
you perfectly acquainted with everything, and also to
settle our accounts. Be not uneasy if you do not
receive any letters from your correspondent by the
packet-boat. At this season, all the great folks in
England are dispersed at their country-houses, and
your friend, perhaps, will defer writing to you until
he gets your last letters.</p>

but the infamous conduct of those two maids torments
me daily. One of them has driven her father-in-law
from his home, and the other has been turned out of
doors by the man’s wife where she lived. I have
always found that giving too much education was only
painting a character over, and that, needs must,
whatever is born in man will, sooner or later, show
itself. Too much education is what has spoiled France,
and has made the French monkey-philosophers, and

<p class="indent2">Monsieur,</p>

<p class="indent5">Hardly was I recovered from my migraine
and inflammation in my eyes, when, lo! all my people
fall ill—the little black girl and all—and I have been
tormented and tired to death: but, thank God, they
are now all well again!</p>

<p>I have delayed writing to you, expecting always to
have letters by the steamer; but, when I reflect on it,
I doubt if I shall receive any until Parliament meets—at
least, that will be the excuse, and they will say
that everybody is just now out of town.</p>

<p>It will be curious to see how they will prove their
right to conceal from me that money had been left me.
I understand clearly that there are two legacies (one I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
have been informed of by an indirect, but a very certain
channel, since I saw you); a considerable one and a
small one. If I were spiteful, I could make them
repent of their doings in a court of justice: but, even
as it is, the matter cannot be passed over without
creating some noise in the world.</p>

<p>I have twice advised Mr. Coutts that I should
draw on him, after the 10th of October, both for my
pension and the £950 which fell due in September;
and, after the repeated assurances which they have
made, that, in future, they will be punctual in their
payments, I can’t think they will play me any more
tricks, especially when they will have so much to do
for me since the discovery which I have made.
Therefore, will you let me know if you have money
enough by you to cash a bill of £300, before the
money from England comes to hand. Of that amount,
I wish you to keep 200 gazi for expenses.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Lady Hester now told me that, having written
ineffectually to a nobleman on the subject, she had
turned over in her thoughts where she could find a fit
person, in whom she could confide, to ascertain the
truth of these matters, and to whom she could write,
with the request that he would make the necessary
inquiries. She had deliberated a long while whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
it should be a lawyer, a man of business, or one of her
old friends. Among the latter, from first to last, she
added, “I have thought Sir Francis Burdett would
be the one I could most assuredly confide in.” In
speaking of him, she said, “He is a man of feeling,
doctor, and he and I were always the best of friends.
I recollect, when I told him how basely two or three
people had behaved on Mr. Pitt’s death, he was ready
to go beside himself: his hand went into the breast of
his waistcoat and out again, as if he could not contain
his indignation. What do you think?—would not he
be the proper person? I always said Sir Francis was
no democrat. He threw himself into the hands of the
people merely that he might have an excuse of business
to be out, or by himself. All the democrats that I
have known were nothing but aristocrats at heart—ay,
and worse than others. Even Horne Tooke was not a
democrat—that I am sure of, by the court he always
paid me, and by his constantly making so many civil
speeches to me and of me. I have never known a man
yet, if he was not to be bought, that was not a democrat
from personal motives.”</p>

<p>In fine, it was resolved to write to Sir Francis, and a
rough copy of a letter was drawn up by Lady Hester’s
dictation, which, after some verbal alterations, she
thought would do. Several remarks, quite foreign to
the subject, were introduced, announcing the researches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
she had made as to the Eastern origin of the Irish and
Scotch; and, as Lady Hester kept constantly saying
to me, “Will this letter do? do you see anything that
wants altering?” a question very usual with her when
dictating letters, I forgot Gil Blas’s warning, and very
distinctly expressed my apprehensions lest the introduction
of the opinions about the affinity of the Irish
and the Koreýsh should make Sir F. think her
cracked. For, I observed, his studies, most probably,
have never led him to investigate these subjects,
which, thus introduced into a letter on business, might
be made a handle for the ill-natured comments of
people who disliked her. She thanked me, but retained
them all, and only requested me to write them out
fair. I did so, and inadvertently skipped a page,
which, when the sheet was full, created some confusion
in reading it. So, resolving to rewrite it, I merely
submitted it to Lady Hester’s perusal, whilst I rode
down to see my family. But I was there seized with
a phlegmonous inflammation of my leg, which, in one
night, from the irritation of the stirrup-leather (rudely
made, as it always is in Turkey), assumed so alarming
a character,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> and was so painful, that I took to my
bed and kept it eleven days. I wrote a note to Lady
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
Hester, describing my situation, requesting her to
send me the letter to Sir F. in order that I might
write it over again: but, hearing that I suffered a
great deal, she said it was not necessary; and, sealing
the copy she had got, she despatched it by a foot-messenger
to Beyrout to go by the <a id="chg5"></a>steamboat.</p>

<p>September 12.—We were thus occupied until this
day, with the exception of the many hours passed by
Lady Hester in diatribes on women and their husbands;
she endeavouring to prove that, in almost all
possible cases, women should be simple automatons,
moved by the will and guidance of their masters. Her
fertile memory brought a vast number of cases to bear
on her argument; cases which she had seen in high
life during her time, where gentlemen, otherwise of
estimable character, became the ridicule of society from
suffering themselves to be ruled by their wives. But
Lord F. was the one whose example she dwelt upon
most strenuously.</p>

<p>“Women,” she would say, “must be one of three
things. Either they are politicians and literary characters;
or they must devote their time to dress,
pleasure, and love; or, lastly, they must be fond of
domestic affairs. I do not mean by domestic affairs a
woman who sits working at her needle, scolding a
couple of children, and sending her maid next door to
the shop for all she wants: there is no trouble in that.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
What I mean is a yeoman’s wife, who takes care of
the butter and cheese, sees the poultry-yard attended
to, and looks to her husband’s comfort and interest.
As for the advantage of passing your evenings with
your family, which you urge as a reason for having
them near you,” she remarked, “all sensible men that
I have ever heard of take their meals with their wives,
and then retire to their own room to read, write, or
do what they have to do, or what best pleases them.
If a man is a fox-hunter, he goes and talks with his
huntsmen or the grooms, and very good company they
are; if he is a tradesman, he goes into his shop; if a
doctor, to his patients; but nobody is such a fool as to
moider away his time in the slip-slop conversation of a
pack of women.”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>I happened to observe that many clever men had
not only passed their hours with their families, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
even studied and wrote surrounded by them; and I
named four or five that occurred to my recollection,
one of whom was C——. “Did you ever hear me
say there were not more fools than one in the world?”—She
rejoined, “As for Mr. C——, I knew him;
so you need not talk to me about him. Mrs. C——!
there was a woman!—Charles C. was one of the
greatest <i lang="fr">roués</i> in London—always drunk. He was in
the Blues, and took it into his head to fall in love
with a Rt. Hble.—very ugly—but her relations
would not let her marry him. Perhaps he wanted
her money; he was very agreeable. Mr. C. lived
in a very hugger-mugger sort of a way, with a maid
of all work and a boy, and it was his daughter who
did most things for him. Perhaps he was not rich
enough to have another room to study in.”</p>

<p>In this sort of way would Lady Hester Stanhope
argue on most subjects, running from one thing to
another, and then, when you thought she had lost
sight of her text, returning to it with some pithy
observation, which generally settled the point to her
own satisfaction.</p>

<p>September 29.—I remained at Mar Elias, confined
with my bad leg, from the 13th until this day, when
I returned to Jôon. Letters and messengers had, in
the interim, been passing between M. Guys and
Lady Hester Stanhope respecting a house which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
was employed to hire for me and my family; but I
had reason to think afterwards that she had no wish
to get rid of us, as the house was reserved for the
Baroness de Fériat, and the correspondence could
tend to no other purpose than to throw odium upon
Mrs. —— as a discontented and capricious woman.</p>

<p>During my confinement, Lady Hester Stanhope
wrote the following letter to my daughter, then hardly
out of her childhood.</p>

<p>I was pleased to find, my dear little Eugenia, that
you inherit your father’s good-will towards me. I
must thank you and Mademoiselle Longchamp for
your kind offers of assistance, but I must decline
them, having taken a determination not to have anything
more to do with the doctor’s family than if it
did not exist in the country. I should forget my
situation and rank in life were I to condescend to dispute
and make daily explanations to my inferiors.
To avoid this, I must give up all thoughts of making
your acquaintance, although you are an object of
interest to me, as would be all the children of the
doctor, even if he had a hundred. Request him
not to think about my letters or anything else that
relates to me; only let him take care of his health.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
If I can be useful to a sick person, nothing is unpleasant
to me; but, when I cannot, or rather am
not, permitted to be, the history of the progress of
sores is not very agreeable. I do not wish to hear of
him till he is recovered. Writing must fatigue him,
and I would rather be without letters from you or him.</p>

<p>I have had a letter from M. Guys to-day, in
which he tells me he was thinking of taking a ride
to see some houses to hire for your family. I shall
send to Beyrout on Thursday before daylight, and
the doctor’s letters will go by that messenger. He
had better write a few lines more to M. Guys, to
explain what situation and what sort of a house he
would like, as it would appear that I am grown a fool
in my old age, and neither know my right hand from
my left.</p>

<p>The doctor is aware that he may command anything
my house contains which may be useful to him;
but I shall neither send him anything, nor inquire
after him, as my messenger was thus ill received:<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
and I do not think I can be called upon to put my
eyes out by writing, when I more than want the sight
I have left for my own affairs.</p>

The frame of Lady Hester’s mind at this period
may be further understood from the following letter,
which was sent to me, with a secret injunction to read
it to my wife.</p>


<p class="p2 center">
<i>To Dr. ——, at Mar Elias.</i>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right r2">
Djôon, Sept. 23, 1837.
</p>

<p>Whilst waiting for M. Guys’ answer, I have some
remarks to make, worthy of your attention. I do not
speak in wrath, my dear doctor, but I do not see how,
at this period, you are to help yourself; and it is
plain to perceive that you will not be able in any way
to accomplish the objects you came for. Therefore, I
should deem it as an act of folly to stick you up as a
sort of <dfn>maskara</dfn><a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> in the public eye at Beyrout, merely
to write a few letters. The whole of my business
M. Guys offered to undertake before I sent for you,
and to come here and write for me; but I had reasons
for wishing you to come, which no longer exist; for
under no circumstances do I see that you would be
comfortable near me, nor should I wish for it, either
at present or in future. Therefore, if you like to pass
the winter at Cyprus, where, perhaps, you would be
more comfortable than at Beyrout, you are at full
liberty to do so. When my affairs are settled, you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
might then, if Cyprus pleases you, purchase a little
<i lang="fr">terre</i> there, or return to Europe, as you like best.</p>

<p>I am very glad that you wrote to M. Guys yourself;
for I had described a country-house near some
village, and you have described a sort of coffee-house
near the gate of the town. You talked to me of Mrs.
——’s great love of retirement (which I laughed at,
at the time,) and therefore she chooses a house upon
the high road. But leave all that childish vulgar
stuff; I do not wish for a hasty answer, as this subject
requires reflection. Try and make yourself comfortable,
and I shall find means of settling my business to my
satisfaction; only I must have a clear and distinct
answer, that I may make arrangements accordingly.</p>

<p class="center">
Your sincerely,
</p>

<p class="right r2">
<span class="smcap">Hester Lucy Stanhope</span>.
</p>

<p>PS. Should my messenger retard, it is for M. Guys
to be able to answer your letter about the house. I
enclosed your two letters to be forwarded to England.
Do not fidget yourself about me. I have made many
awful sacrifices in my life; surely I can make a small
one, when I know what it is. This is what distinguishes
the truly great from the low and vulgar.</p>

<p>On returning to the Dar, I remained there eight
days. Our conversations turned principally, during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
this period, on her father’s seat at Chevening, the
people in that neighbourhood, and the happiness of
her early days there. She recollected the names of
all the gentry thereabouts, of the farmers, as also of
her father’s servants, and could tell anecdotes respecting
them with such a minuteness of particulars, that
the individuals, to their surprise, after the lapse of so
many years, would have found she remembered more
of them than they did of themselves.</p>

House of Commons.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_74" href="#FNanchor_74" class="label">[74]</a> The book here meant is M. Lamartine’s <span lang="fr">“Souvenirs de
l’Orient.”</span> What Lady Hester here refers to as incorrect relates
to her journey into the Desert with Mr. Lascaris; about
which, and about the dispute with Mr. L. it is not likely that
M. Lamartine could know the particulars; nor does this
in the least deprive M. Lamartine of the just merit accorded to
him, of having been the first traveller to give Europe some accurate
notions about Lady Hester in her retirement.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_78" href="#FNanchor_78" class="label">[78]</a> A great philosopher reasoned on this point like Lady Hester.
According to him: <span lang="fr">“La femme et le mari sont bien destinés à
vivre ensemble, mais non pas de la même manière; ils doivent
agir de concert, sans faire les mêmes choses. La vie qui charmeroit
l’un seroit insupportable à l’autre; les inclinations que
leur donne la nature sont aussi diverses que les fonctions qu’elle
leur impose: leurs amusemens ne différent pas moins que leurs
devoirs; en un mot, tous deux concourent au bonheur commun
par des chemins differens, et ce partage de travaux et de soins
est le plus fort lien de leur union.”—<abbr title="Lettre 14">Let. xiv.</abbr> 3<i>me</i> partie
<abbr title="Nouvelle Heloise"><i>Nouv. Hel.</i></abbr></span></p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_79" href="#FNanchor_79" class="label">[79]</a> I had declined rather pettishly some articles of dress
which Lady Hester had sent me, and to this she alludes.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="#Page_78">Page 78</a>-87—The Emir Beshýr.</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">In relating these conversations, which place the character
of the Emir Beshýr in so disadvantageous a light, it would be
unfair not to call the attention of the reader to a work recently
published (Memoirs of a Babylonian Princess), in which the
Emir is held up as a model of all Christian virtues, and his
reign as a reign of peace.</p>

<p>As a romance, the Memoirs of the Princess may challenge
a comparison with many works of our best novelists. The
authoress seems to have a most unbounded indulgence for the
errors of others; but the Emir Beshýr, notwithstanding, must
still be left with all his stains upon him, as a wily, sanguinary,
and perfidious, but successful prince.</p>

<p>It is not pretended that Lady Hester Stanhope did not
personally dislike the Emir Beshýr; and, as her hatreds were
as cordial as her friendships, she never spared him when she
spoke of him to others, whilst her language, no doubt, was
at all times highly coloured: but, unhappily, there are too
many notorious facts to justify the abuse she lavishes on
him, as regards his cruelties; only, if it is any palliation of
his conduct that he had to deal with chieftains who were as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
great adepts in machiavelism as himself, this excuse is conceded
to him.</p>

<p>In vol. ii., p. 160, the Amira Asmar informs her readers
that the Emir Beshýr had put his two nephews to death to
punish their treason in attempting his downfall. Now everybody
in Mount Lebanon knows that the nephews had their
eyes put out, and, as it was affirmed, were subjected to
the loss of organs equally dear to Oriental husbands with
sight itself, but were not put to death, and possibly are living
now.</p>

<p>In vol. ii., p. 158, we read, “The Emir had been in power
forty years, and, by the firmness and liberality of his policy,
had continued, during the long period, to consolidate the
jarring and heterogeneous elements committed to his sway into
something like a united body; insomuch that peace reigned in
the mountain, and the Moslem thirsted not for the blood of his
Christian fellow-subject. In short, Maronite, Motowli, Mahometan,
and Druze, looked upon each other as brethren.” A
little before this (vol. ii., p. 140), she tells us, “I was at length
under the protection of a prince whose vigorous arm upheld
the dignity of Christianity in the East, and bid its followers
confess their God without fear.”</p>

<p>In another place (vol. ii., p. 187), we read, “Soon afterwards
Lady Hester Stanhope rose, and, bidding us farewell,
took her departure, attended by a large retinue. A spirited
charger stood at the gate, champing the bit with fiery impatience.
She put her foot in the stirrup, and, vaulting nimbly
into the saddle, which she, after the Oriental fashion, bestrode
like a man, started off at a rapid pace, galloping over rock and
mountain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span></p>

<p>Vol. ii., page 203, will afford us one quotation more; and,
whilst it must be a matter of regret to raise a doubt of the correctness
of the Amira’s recollections, it still will be necessary to
vindicate the present publication from being the vehicle of
falsehoods. It is there said, “The Queen of Tadmor, as Lady
Hester Stanhope was commonly called by all the Bedouin
tribes, was on the most friendly terms with the Emir Beshýr
and his family, and a constant visitant to the garden.”</p>

<p>It will be in our power to answer all these somewhat erroneous
assertions, by relating the substance of a conversation
with Lady Hester, not embodied in the text. The conversation
was as <span class="lock">follows:—</span></p>

<p>“What would you say, Doctor, if a monster should send his
executioner to tear your little girl, Eugenia, from you, and
put her to death? what would be your horror? Yet the
Emir Beshýr was capable of this; for when the wretched and
unfortunate wife of the Sheykh Beshýr was flying from the
terrors that surrounded her, he issued an order that her boy
should be torn asunder wherever found. I was by no means
intimate or attached to that woman; but her misfortunes required
that I should assist her, and humanity justified it, as
she was, at the time, without a parra, and flying through the
snow. She had four or five children, two of which were in
prison at Acre with the father, (who was afterwards strangled
there, as you know,) and one was suckling at her breast.</p>

<p>“The Emir will never forget or forgive what I did on that
occasion; for with Hanah” (this was a poor blind peasant, about
whom I had been speaking, and the mention of whom led to the
conversation) “and another, who were but lads then, I thwarted
all his detestable plans, although he had his myrmidons in all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
directions out in search of her. Hanah was nearly lost in the
snow, and the effect of the glare on his sight he never recovered.
Most people called me a fool for my pains, and trembled
at the consequences for me in opposing a powerful prince;
but I am not one of your quiet sort, who sit in a corner, and
grunt and lament, because they are afraid to act. Humanity
raised her voice, that I should endeavour to rescue these
wretched orphans, and I did it. With the intrigues of these
two rivals, the Emir and the Sheykh, I never meddled: I have
never seen the one or the other since the death of Sulymàn
Pasha.” Now Sulymàn Pasha died before 1822, consequently
Lady Hester Stanhope could not have been intimate with the
Emir, nor have mounted her horse at his gate subsequent
to 1825, which, if my recollection serves me (for I copied the
quotations and returned the book), is the date of the Amira’s
anecdotes.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><a href="#Page_106">Page 106.</a>—“The room bore no resemblance.”</p>

<p>In perusing these pages, the reader is requested to bear constantly
in mind the distinction there is between the usages of
the East and those of England. Reflections and observations,
if made on some of the incidents in this work, which would
apply with irresistible truth in our own country and would
necessarily have much weight attached to them, fall still-born
from the pen in relation to Orientals. This reservation is
called for more particularly in reference to the scenes which
pass in Lady Hester Stanhope’s bed-chamber.</p>

<p>At the word <em>bed-chamber</em> we naturally figure to ourselves
a four-post bedstead with tester and curtains, with paillasse,
mattress, and feather bed, with marseilles quilt, and perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
an eider-down one upon that, with a marble dressing-table and
<i lang="fr">lavabou</i>, and an endless display of rouge-pots, combs, hair-brushes,
and the paraphernalia of a fashionable toilet-table.
With one breath all this must be blown to the winds; Turkish
ladies never know even the existence of such things. Some
cupboard in a corner, or some brass-nailed box, contains whatever
they want for cosmetical purposes, and a visit to the bath
supplies all the rest.</p>

<p>In Eastern countries there is no room bearing even the
name of bed-room; for there are no fixed bedsteads, no fixed
washing-stands, no fixed dressing-tables. Every room is
a saloon; and, when night comes, from a recess or niche in
the thick walls of their houses, covered by a curtain, is drawn
forth a wool mattress with a sheet, which are spread
on the floor-matting. Upon this ready couch the lovely
daughters of those favoured regions throw themselves dressed
(let not this be lost sight of—dressed) very much in the same
clothes as in the day-time, even to the turban, and draw over
their persons a wadded quilt, to which is sewed the upper sheet,
as a certain way of preventing it from shifting its position with
reference to the quilt. Nothing else appears in the room, and
ingress and egress is as free when ladies are in bed as at any
other hour: hence the reason why the peasant spoken of at
p. 62 of this volume so unceremoniously enters where Lady
Hester is lying. In some houses, where the sofas are of sufficient
breadth, even the mattress is dispensed with, and the quilt
alone is all that is required for the night’s repose.</p>

<p>Lady Hester had adopted the same mode of sleeping. Her
bed-room differed in nothing from the one described, excepting
that, from an invincible repugnance to sleep on the floor, yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
unable to procure a European bedstead, she had substituted
in its place deal planks laid on trestles, which were stationary;
and this was a constant source of difficulty and ridicule with
the maids, whose prejudices against an immoveable bed never
were entirely eradicated. On this she slept, attired as completely
as when up, and the most scrupulous prudery could
find no difference between her couch and her drawing-room
sofa, unless it was that on one she lay, on the other she sat.
Most often, however, when in conversation, she sat up in her
bed, with a short pelisse over her shoulders, such as Polish
ladies often wear. Her bath-room was her dressing-room.</p>

<p>In the early part of my life I was acquainted with the
Prince C——, Hospodar of Wallachia, who had fled from his
principality to Geneva. I never shall forget the impression
which an introduction to his daughter, a young princess, made
on me, when (not for a medical visit, but for one of friendship)
I was ushered into a bed-room and shook hands with
her, seated in her bed, dressed in the way represented above
as usual with the Turks. Guests went and came as if she had
been in the drawing-room, and, no doubt, some two or three
Europeans among the number were as much astonished as
myself. But how frivolous and empty are the distinctions
which men create between right and wrong, when weighed in
the balance of reason! I have dined with a French countess
(who had taken a temporary lodging in Paris) in her bed-room;
yet she never dreamed of impropriety; but I have been told,
had I inadvertently put my hat down on her bed instead of
a chair, her <i lang="fr">femme-de-chambre</i> and she herself would have
been scandalized at the imputation such an act conveyed.</p>

<p>“Lady Hamilton was a woman **** **** whom Sir
William H. fell in with here when he began to doat, and married
when his doatage was confirmed: she is clever and artful,
but a sad **.”—<cite>Diaries and Correspondence of the Earl of

<p class="p2 center"><a href="#Page_270">Page 270.</a>—“P—— of W——, who was a sloven.”</p>

<p>“Argument with the Princess about her toilette; she piques
herself on dressing quick; I disapprove this. She maintains
her point; I, however, desire Madame Busche to explain to
her that the Prince is very delicate, and that he expects a long
and very careful ‘<i lang="fr">toilette de propreté</i>,’ of which she has no
idea. On the contrary, she neglects it sadly, and is <em>offensive</em>
from this neglect.”</p>

<p>In this extract from Lord Malmesbury’s Diary, it will be
seen how accurate his observations were, and how well they
tally with Lady Hester Stanhope’s, who must have had opportunities
of knowing all this even better than his Lordship could.</p>

<p>His Lordship in his diary again returns to the subject. “I
endeavoured,” (says he) “as far as was possible for a <em>man</em>, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
inculcate the necessity of great and nice attention to every part
of dress, as well as to what was hid as to what was seen. I
knew she wore coarse petticoats, coarse shifts, and thread
stockings, and these never well washed, or changed often
enough.... It is remarkable how amazingly her education
has been neglected, and how much her mother, although an
English woman, was inattentive to it.”—<cite>Diaries and Correspondence
of the Earl of Malmesbury</cite>, <abbr title="volume three pages">v. iii. pp.</abbr> 207, 211.</p>
